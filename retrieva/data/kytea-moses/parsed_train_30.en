* Optimistic Locking
To get Rails saying &quot; Hello &quot; , you need to create at minimum a _ controller _ and a ╼ _ view _ .

It does this by checking whether another process has made changes to a record since it was opened .
Rails offers two different ways to declare a many-to-many relationship between models .

You &apos;ll find that it &apos;s the same as when it was only an ╼ engine .
Consider these models :
You can also use this method to query for multiple objects .
For example , Action Pack uses this method to load the class that provides a certain session store :
Here is an example for version 3 ▖ 0 ▖ 4 :
╼ \ end { equation }
invoke scss
The user \ kode { edit } action .
# # # Sending Multipart Emails

def initialize
The user show page after adding a Users resource .
Mime : : Type ▖ register &apos; application / json-patch + json &apos; , : json _ patch
╼ = &gt; &quot; the user &quot;
render action : &quot; edit &quot;
Assets inside subdirectories can also be accessed .

# # # # Options for `belongs _ to`

# # # `class _ eval ( * args , &amp; block ) `
The default is `ActionView : : Helpers : : FormBuilder` .
# # # Routing concerns
The method `split` divides an array by a separator and returns the resulting chunks .
# &lt; id &gt; 4356 &lt; / id &gt;
Eager Loading Associations
&lt; script &gt; alert ( &apos; Hello &apos; ) ; &lt; / script &gt;
`ids` can be used to pluck all the IDs for the relation using the table &apos;s primary key .
f &quot; ) # = &gt; true
The default \ kode { Gemfile } in the \ kode { first \ _ app } directory .
Of course , we also want to validate the presence of email addresses .
The SQL that would be executed would be something like this :
$ bin / rails generate scaffold article title : string text : text

Sass mixins allow a group of CSS rules to be bundled and reused in multiple places .
My favorite Rails deployment option is Heroku , which is a hosted platform built specifically for deploying Rails and other web applications
For example , you might have a view that looked like this :
This behavior can be turned off by setting `ActiveRecord : : Base ▖ lock _ optimistically = false` .
Putting this into the login form gives the code shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : remember _ me _ checkbox } .

On the other hand , regular comments do not use an arrow :

* They do not work with ` : through` associations .
Consider the following code , which finds 10 clients and prints their postcodes :

Meanwhile , the code

Ajax isn &apos;t just client-side , you also need to do some work on the server ╼ side to support it .
We see here the default console representation of a user object .
The relationships between these classes is illustrated in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : demo _ controller _ inheritance } .

Action View templates are written using embedded Ruby in tags mingled with HTML .

Another common model is to expire the session after a certain amount of time .
Date ▖ new ( 2010 , 2 , 28 ) ▖ advance ( days : 1 ) ▖ advance ( months : 1 )
You can do this by running this ╼ command :

Here \ kode { remember \ _ digest } is an attribute on the User model , and inside the model we can rewrite it as follows :
An example with a predicate :

In effect , by enclosing the button click in a block we are able to replace

If you have code that looks like ╼ this , you must change your code to do this instead :
subject : &apos; Welcome to My Awesome Site &apos; ,
c2 ▖ name = &quot; should fail &quot;
You can prefix routes with a named parameter also :
# Use CoffeeScript for ▖ js ▖ coffee assets and views

user _ name : &apos; &lt; username &gt; &apos; ,

An alternative and cleaner syntax is to nest the hash conditions :
If the source filename has no extension , ▖ css will be appended .
# # # # The `assert _ recognizes` Assertion
Strips all link tags from text leaving just the link text .
For example , you may wish to create a ╼ `test / models` directory for your model tests .

For example this :
the corresponding account activation link &apos;s base URL will look like this :
\ href { http : / / guides ▖ rubyonrails ▖ org / } { Rails Guides } : Good topical and up-to-date Rails references
This command will generate four files :
encoding : utf8
# = = Schema Information
One way to fix this is to redirect instead of rendering :
Everything in Ruby , including strings and even \ kode { nil } , is an \ emph { object } .
# # # `after _ bundle` in Rails templates

class Order &lt; ActiveRecord : : Base

The second method looks like this :

# Generates a date select that defaults to today ( no specified date )
# # # # `camelize`
&quot; foo &quot; ▖ duplicable ?
: discount _ cannot _ be _ greater _ than _ total _ value
Everything this generator has created is neatly namespaced .
The method `symbolize _ keys` returns a hash that has a symbolized version of the keys in the receiver , where possible .

The toy app developed in this chapter has several strengths and a host of weaknesses .

The final part of the layout is a \ kode { div } for the main content :
require &apos; other _ engine / engine&apos;

Next , we &apos;ll add a Rake task to create sample users .

Of course , even the subselect won &apos;t scale forever .

Active Support extends slicing to hashes :
Form With Errors &#93; ( images / getting _ started / form _ with _ errors ▖ png )
If the index is greater than the length of the array , it returns an empty array .
If we want to display the properties of all the books in our view , we can do so with an ERB template like this :
def full _ messages
# # # # `in _ groups ( number , fill _ with = nil ) `
Also check your environment settings for `config ▖ action _ dispatch ▖ best _ standards _ support` and remove it if present .
Rails also creates a default `app / assets / stylesheets / application ▖ css` file ╼ which contains these lines :
# Generate a new token and store it in token _ file .
# # # # Examples from the Underground
# = &gt; ActiveRecord : : RecordNotFound
WHERE follower _ id = : user _ id &quot;
Finally , routes will also be isolated within the engine .

For example , here &apos;s a small section of the `rake routes` output for a RESTful route :

* Filters can be specified with a block or a symbol to a method in the mailer ╼ class similar to controllers .

By default , the engine &apos;s controllers inherit from ╼ `Blorgh : : ApplicationController` .

All of these lessons , of course , apply ╼ to vanilla JavaScript as well .
Our first step is to generate an integration test as usual :
For example :
Testing for the \ kode { : name } and \ kode { : email } attributes .
# # # # `app` Directory
After restarting Sublime Text , the RubyTest package supplies the following commands :
The code \ kode { user ▖ microposts ▖ build ( ▖ ▖ ▖ ) } returns a new Micropost object automatically associated with the given user .
Rails &apos; \ kode { has \ _ many : through } allows the modeling of complicated data relationships .
If the first matching route is :
foo : bar
Our first step is to write a failing test for the About page .
route resources : users
But the attacker can review their web server &apos;s access log files to see the victim &apos;s cookie .
We &apos;ll then use the failing test to drive the writing of the application code .

http : / / mycdnsubdomain ▖ fictional-cdn ▖ com / assets / smile ▖ png
The next level is to simply load all extensions to `Object` .

DOCTYPE html &gt;
# gem &apos; libnotify &apos; , &apos; 0 ▖ 8 ▖ 0&apos;
Adding Factory Girl to the \ kode { Gemfile } .
Here the return value is \ kode { nil } because the \ kode { home } action is blank .
Data accessible to the public ( e ▖ g ▖ , via web browsers ) , such as error pages
For example , the sample application \ kode { production ▖ rb } configuration file appears as follows :
&lt; / head &gt;
Finally , it &apos;s often convenient to use the ternary operator in a function &apos;s return value :
The account activation text view .
Do not attempt to use `include ? ` to enforce distinctness ╼ in an association .
To avoid this , add the following line to your test environment :
A test for the user &apos;s \ kode { microposts } attribute .
╼ = &gt; &quot; test &quot;
exist app / views / microposts
Breaking down the valid email regex .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : users _ fixtures _ extra _ users } .

Adding a test for the ``Settings &apos; &apos; link .
Be sure to get first to Red , and then to Green .
# # # # number _ with _ delimiter
The effect is that Rails insulates you almost entirely from the details of the data store .
Mailing the account activation link .
As required , initially our test suite is passing ( \ passing ) .

At this point , all the tests should be \ passing :

File Names
And to remove browser related middleware ,
The CSS in Listing ~ \ ref { code : logo _ css } converts the text to uppercase and modifies its size , color , and placement .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sign _ in _ function } .
At this point , the tests should be \ passing :
&lt; % = stylesheet _ link _ tag &quot; application &quot; , debug : true % &gt;
Analogously , `all _ week` , `all _ month` , `all _ quarter` and `all _ year` all serve the purpose of generating time ranges .
Computes the url to a JavaScript asset in the `app / assets / javascripts` directory .
You might get a &quot; This ╼ won &apos;t be accepted ▖ &quot;
Despite this impressive list , there is still much to learn about Rails .
The first line indicates that we are describing the Home page .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : help _ view _ full _ html } and
content _ type : &quot; text / plain &quot; ,
A sample account activation email from the server log .
This is the case , for example , in the code
For example , it may be important to your application to ensure that ╼ every user provides a valid email address and mailing address .
Install RubyGems
Everything else is the same as `form _ for` .
time _ range = ( Time ▖ now ▖ midnight - 1 ▖ day ) ▖ .
This would generate SQL like :
```html + erb

( Why don &apos;t we have to test the stats on the Home page separately ? )
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ dependency _ test } .
The login form is designed to create a new session to log a user in .
This chapter will cover all of these ideas as well .
* `stylesheet _ engine` configures the stylesheet engine ( for eg ▖ sass ) to be used when generating assets .

You can stack callbacks on a single event by passing them as an array :

It also includes a validation for the \ kode { password \ _ digest } attribute ▖ )
* ` : polymorphic`
Safe updating through the web is enforced using strong parameters .
The default error message for this helper is _ &quot; doesn &apos;t match confirmation &quot; _ .

Turning the model into this :

With that , apart from one refinement , the basic functionality of user activation is done .
Signing in the user upon signup .
# # # `find _ or _ initialize _ by`
In the case of the StaticPages controller , both its methods are initially empty :
layout false
In this section , we &apos;ll give our lonely sample user some company .
&lt; % = submit _ tag % &gt;
At this point , all the tests should be passing :

The `create _ association` method returns a new object of the associated type .

The complete steps needed to get the signin features to pass .
In this chapter , we &apos;ll develop a toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails .
This method call will look something like this :
to your `Client` model .
You can define assets for precompilation in `engine ▖ rb` :
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : first _ migration } .
You can also render a block of code within a partial layout instead of calling `yield` .
@ url = user _ url ( @ user )
client = Client ▖ readonly ▖ first
Linking the button to the Signup page .
* `config ▖ middleware ▖ use ( new _ middleware , args ) ` - Adds the new middleware at the bottom of the middleware stack .
You can quickly test the RDoc output with the following command :
For coherence with the built-in methods only relative paths are accepted .
Or you can remove them .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : edit _ update _ wrong _ user _ tests } .
( As noted above , testing the third branch is left as an exercise ▖ )
In the rare circumstance that an exercise solution is used subsequently , it is explicitly solved in the main text .

The method `foreign _ key` gives a foreign key column name from a class name .

The second way to declare a many-to-many relationship is to use `has _ many : through` .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : signup _ route } .
The following list explains the purpose of each of them :

Since we &apos;ll be making a controller to handle static pages , we &apos;ll call it the StaticPages controller .
The method `years _ ago` receives a number of years and returns the same date those many years ago :
# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
We can create a large number of test users using embedded Ruby inside fixtures .
# perform a partial update
which is only a marker , its body or return value are irrelevant .
Using a \ kode { div } tag in place of \ kode { footer } would work as well .
A preliminary version of the Sessions \ kode { create } action .

Before moving on to tackle any of the application extensions , it &apos;s a good idea to merge in your changes :
Here are some suggestions based on my own experience :
# Use ActiveModel has _ secure _ password
The login page with a ``forgot password &apos; &apos; link .
# you &apos;ve limited to : test , : development , or : production .

The \ kode { show \ _ follow } view used to render following and followers .
You may prefer just to load all core extensions , there is a file for that :

Let &apos;s focus on one particular line in Listing ~ \ ref { code : application _ layout _ redux } :
Now let &apos;s take a look at the above steps in more detail .
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key .

We can run all of our JavaScript through a minimizer and ╼ concatenator .

Using the `config / database ▖ yml` file you can specify all the information needed to access your database :
We might write this schematically as follows :
We start by requiring a User object to respond to \ kode { authenticate } :
Now running
* `mail` - Sends the actual email itself .
You can also specify the ` : shallow` option in the parent resource , in which case all of the nested resources will be shallow :
This simply involves filling in the second arguments of the \ kode { link \ _ to } functions with the proper named routes .
&#124; &#124; 508 &#124; : loop _ detected &#124;
If you have an extension that should be shared by many associations , you can use a named extension module .
We prefer pull requests ╼ that are a single commit .
The next step is to make the class that represents a `User` in the application ╼ customizable for the engine .

Then commit the changes and push up to Heroku :
Mailers are structured much like controller actions , with email templates defined as views .

This is not a cause for concern , as Ruby ignores extra newlines .

In particular , because hashes return \ kode { nil } for nonexistent keys , code like

Meanwhile , the second line of \ kode { remember } uses the \ kode { update \ _ attribute } method to update the remember digest ▖ (
Rails also adapts rapidly to new developments in web technology and framework design .

In addition , sometimes the test database gets corrupted and needs to be reset .
This is why the code
$ git fetch rails

Using a digest for password resets is thus essential .

Like all of the other components of an engine , the assets should be namespaced ▖ ╼
These are \ emph { system } setups , meaning you only have to do them once per computer :
# # # Using the `content _ for` Method
The User model returns the list of users to the controller .
The secure password source code has a line for this as well :
We can get started by generating a template test , which we &apos;ll call \ kode { site \ _ layout } :

Doing so can lead to orphaned records in your database .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : real _ account _ activation _ test } .

If there was no `where` condition , this would generate the normal set of two queries .
create app / assets / javascripts / application ▖ js

# # # Using a String with ` : if` and ` : unless`
# Replace ActionDispatch : : ShowExceptions with Lifo : : ShowExceptions
We &apos;ll start , as usual , with our tests .
Choose these in certain , specific cases .

Active Record provides the ` : inverse _ of` option so that you can inform it of these relations :
so its output is ready to be used in a query string .
# # # # Durations
This migration can be simplified by using the `t ▖ references` form :
get &apos; photos / : id &apos; , to : &apos; photos # show&apos;
update user with id \ kode { 1 }
&lt; option value = &quot; 1 &quot; &gt; Egypt &lt; / option &gt;
For instance :
The user \ kode { update } action .
The method `present ? ` is equivalent to ` ! blank ? ` .
And the following in your routes file :
# # # Live Compilation
The method `parameterize` normalizes its receiver in a way that can be used in pretty URLs .
It is beyond the scope of this guide to inform you on how to secure your application code and environments .
A method called on an instance , such as \ kode { length } , is called an \ emph { instance method } .
Default Headers
Here both the directory name and filename are important .
# # # # # ` : as`
Using the `new` method , an object can be instantiated without being saved :
# # # # # `DateTime ▖ current`
The problem here is that we are missing an underlying abstraction .
User ▖ find _ each ( batch _ size : 5000 ) do &#124; user &#124;
We then redirect to the root URL with an informative flash message .
Your scope can take arguments :
A failing test for validation of the \ kode { name } attribute .
Now let &apos;s add some links to ╼ navigate through pages .

Formats a number as a percentage string .

This is the middleware which supports the PUT and DELETE HTTP method types .
Consider asking someone from the core team or author of the code before removing it .
Because of the heavy lifting ahead , it &apos;s especially important to review where we &apos;re going .

The first thing to generate for a blog engine is the `Article` model and related ╼ controller .
When you declare a `belongs _ to` association , you need to create foreign keys as appropriate .
Partial Layouts
Users can be updated using an edit form , which sends a \ texttt { PATCH } request to the \ kode { update } action .

If you have an instance of a model to render into a partial , you can use a shorthand syntax :

* * `ActiveRecord : : Migration : : CheckPending` * *

The `has _ and _ belongs _ to _ many` association supports these options :
&lt; script &gt; alert ( &apos; Hello ! &apos; )
# SELECT &quot; users &quot; .
The development dependencies for the gem will only be used ╼ when the tests for the engine are running .

Action Mailer handles the auto encoding of multibyte characters inside of ╼ headers and bodies .

To define one , open ╼ `app / models / blorgh / article ▖ rb` and add this line into the model :
listing } ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Login with remembering } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : login _ with _ remembering } ╼ ╼
All that remains is to add a social layer by letting users follow each other .
Destroying a session ( user logout ) .

A test for a valid ( nonblank ) remember token .
